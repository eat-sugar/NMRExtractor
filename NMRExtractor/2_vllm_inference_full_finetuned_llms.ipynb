Its molecular formula was assigned as C27H36O4 by the HREISMS spectrum in agreement with its 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1). The 1H NMR spectral data exhibited four tertiary methyl groups at δH 0.91, 0.94, 1.05, and 1.18 (each 3H of singlet), and an oxymethylene at δH 3.48 (dd, J = 11.6, 7.7) and 3.74 (dd, J = 11.6, 5.8), together with an oxymethine at δH 4.71 (m). In the spectrum, a series of signals from the benzoyloxy group at values between δH 7.54 and 8.04 was also clearly observed. Other overlapping signals centered between 1.05 and 2.06 ppm are attributed to resonance from either methine or methylene signals. Seven carbon signals corresponding to the benzoyloxy group were not present in the 13C NMR spectrum. The 20 carbon resonances in the spectrum were further classified by DEPT experiments as four methyls (δC 14.4, 14.5, 17.1, and 28.5), six methylene groups with one oxygenated carbon (δC 61.7), six methines containing one oxygenated methine (δC 81.9), as well as four quaternary carbons including one keto carbonyl carbon (δC 210.6). The presence of a cyclopropane ring was deduced from the 1H-1H COSY cross-peaks of H-15 (δH 1.57, dd, J = 7.7, 5.8) with H-14 (δH 1.05, m) and H2-16 (δH 3.48, dd, J = 11.6, 7.7 and 3.74, dd, J = 11.6, 5.8); the HMBC correlations from H2-16 to C-13(δC 34.1), C-14 (δC 38.5), and C-15 (δC 37.9); and from Me-17 (δH 1.18, s) to C-12(δC 210.6), C-13, and C-14 (Figure 1). While the data implied a carbonyl group at C-12 and a hydroxyl group at C-16, a cyclopropane ring between the C-13, C-14, and C-15 formations was observed. Further analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR spectral data (Figures S1–S6) of compound 1 revealed similarities to those of pucherrin R (3) [12], which featured a cleistanthane backbone similar to compound 1, but without a benzoyloxy group at C-3. This evidence was confirmed by the HMBC interactions of H-3 (δH 4.71, m) with C-2 (δC 24.4), C-4 (δC 38.8), Me-18 (δC 17.1), Me-19 (δC 28.5), and carbonyl carbon (δC 166.4). In the NOESY experiment, the correlations of H-3/Me-18 and Me-17/H2-16/Me-18 supported the α orientation of H-3, H2-16, Me-17, and Me-18 (Figure 1). The absolute configuration of 1 was established based on the comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data (Figure 2). Eventually, the absolute stereochemistry of this compound was defined as 3S, 5S, 8R, 9S, 10R, 13R, 14R, and 15R, as shown in Figure 3, owing to the agreement of the calculated ECD curve with the experimental one; this compound was named pulchin A. Notably, pulchin A with an exclusive cleistanthane backbone represents a rare class of cassane diterpenes. [/INST]']"

Its molecular formula was assigned as C27H36O4 by the HREISMS spectrum in agreement with its 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1). The 1H NMR spectral data exhibited four tertiary methyl groups at δH 0.91, 0.94, 1.05, and 1.18 (each 3H of singlet), and an oxymethylene at δH 3.48 (dd, J = 11.6, 7.7) and 3.74 (dd, J = 11.6, 5.8), together with an oxymethine at δH 4.71 (m). In the spectrum, a series of signals from the benzoyloxy group at values between δH 7.54 and 8.04 was also clearly observed. Other overlapping signals centered between 1.05 and 2.06 ppm are attributed to resonance from either methine or methylene signals. Seven carbon signals corresponding to the benzoyloxy group were not present in the 13C NMR spectrum. The 20 carbon resonances in the spectrum were further classified by DEPT experiments as four methyls (δC 14.4, 14.5, 17.1, and 28.5), six methylene groups with one oxygenated carbon (δC 61.7), six methines containing one oxygenated methine (δC 81.9), as well as four quaternary carbons including one keto carbonyl carbon (δC 210.6). The presence of a cyclopropane ring was deduced from the 1H-1H COSY cross-peaks of H-15 (δH 1.57, dd, J = 7.7, 5.8) with H-14 (δH 1.05, m) and H2-16 (δH 3.48, dd, J = 11.6, 7.7 and 3.74, dd, J = 11.6, 5.8); the HMBC correlations from H2-16 to C-13(δC 34.1), C-14 (δC 38.5), and C-15 (δC 37.9); and from Me-17 (δH 1.18, s) to C-12(δC 210.6), C-13, and C-14 (Figure 1). While the data implied a carbonyl group at C-12 and a hydroxyl group at C-16, a cyclopropane ring between the C-13, C-14, and C-15 formations was observed. Further analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR spectral data (Figures S1–S6) of compound 1 revealed similarities to those of pucherrin R (3) [12], which featured a cleistanthane backbone similar to compound 1, but without a benzoyloxy group at C-3. This evidence was confirmed by the HMBC interactions of H-3 (δH 4.71, m) with C-2 (δC 24.4), C-4 (δC 38.8), Me-18 (δC 17.1), Me-19 (δC 28.5), and carbonyl carbon (δC 166.4). In the NOESY experiment, the correlations of H-3/Me-18 and Me-17/H2-16/Me-18 supported the α orientation of H-3, H2-16, Me-17, and Me-18 (Figure 1). The absolute configuration of 1 was established based on the comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data (Figure 2). Eventually, the absolute stereochemistry of this compound was defined as 3S, 5S, 8R, 9S, 10R, 13R, 14R, and 15R, as shown in Figure 3, owing to the agreement of the calculated ECD curve with the experimental one; this compound was named pulchin A. Notably, pulchin A with an exclusive cleistanthane backbone represents a rare class of cassane diterpenes. [/INST],\n",

Small pieces of lithium were carefully added to the mixture until the suspension turned blue. After thirty minutes, NH4Cl (12 g, 0.2 mol) was added. The white solid obtained after the evaporation of the solvent was treated with 3 mol dm−3 HCl (3 × 100 mL). The acidic solution was filtered and then evaporated to dryness, then the resulting solid was dissolved in the minimum amount of water and the solution made alkaline with concentrated NaOH. The liquid was extracted with CHCl3 (6 × 50 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and vacuum-evaporated to obtain a solid that was dissolved in ethanol and treated with 37% HCl/ethanol 1:1 v/v until complete precipitation of a white solid, which was filtered off to obtain L1 as tetrahydrochloride salt (490 mg, 68%).

This pattern is similar than the one of CBP-4Si3 recorded in its liquid state at 20 °C. Both patterns show distinct scattering signals for siloxane segments (hdMS = 6.5–7 Å), and aliphatic or CBP segments (hch + har = 4.5–5 Å), demonstrating the persistence of nanosegregated strata in the liquid state. The periodicity of the strata alternation leads to a further scattering signal in the low-angle region (Dlay = 29 and 27 Å, for CBP-2Si3 and CBP-4Si3, respectively, with similar correlation length ξ ≈ 60 Å, determined from Scherrer formula with shape factor K = 0.9; Figure S7: Illustration of the evolution of the self-organized structures of the CBP derivatives as a function of the siloxane chains content, including molecular parameters issued from Table S5; Figure S8: Left: SWAXS patterns of the CBP-2Si3 in the pristine state at 20 °C (black curve) and in the supercooled liquid phase at 20 °C (blue curve).

Hence, the overall geometry optimization of 5-HMU was analyzed employing the B3LYP method and 6-311++G(d,p) basis set, and with the help of GIAO methodology using the aug-cc-pV5Z def2/J basis set, their chemical shifts value was calculated. The input files have been created with the atomistica online tool [29]. Table 3 shows the actual and estimated chemical shifts for 1H and 13C NMR. In DMSO solvent, the experimental NMR of 5-HMU were recorded and displayed in Figure 3A,B. In 1H NMR, the peaks for hydrogen attached to nitrogen (H11 and H13) were observed at 10.66 and 7.20 ppm and theoretically appeared at 7.06 ppm and 6.75 ppm, respectively. In 13C NMR, the carbonyl carbons (C1 and C5) were observed in the area of 164.31 and 151.85 ppm while the peaks for C3 and C4 carbons were observed at 138.71 and 113.22 ppm, and the peak for C9 carbon appeared at 56.31 ppm, and theoretical spectral peaks are found at 165.94, 153.59, 141.71, 120.20, and 62.23 ppm.  2.4.

In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), signals for a tertiary methyl group at δ 1.40 (3H, d, Me-13), a quaternary methyl group at δ 1.25 (3H, s, Me-14), three oxygenated methine groups at δ 3.73 (1H, H-2), 5.27 (1H, H-6) and 4.64 (1H, H-8), an oxymethine proton belonging to an epoxy group at 2.85 (1H, H-1) and an olefinic proton at δ 7.79 (1H, H-5) were all observed. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2), coupled with HSQC analysis, showed resonances for fifteen carbons (4×C, 7×CH, 2×CH2, 2×CH3), in which two lactone carboxyl carbons, four oxymethines, one oxygenated quaternary carbon, one olefinic methine, and one olefinic quaternary carbon were deduced. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum showed correlations of H-1/H-2/H2-3, H-5/H-6, and H2-9/H-8/H-7/H-11/H3-13, indicating the presence of structural fragments of C-1–C-2–C-3, C-5–C-6 and C-9–C-8–C-7–C-11–C-13 (Figure 2). In the HMBC spectrum, the observation of 1H−13C long-range correlation signals from δH 7.79 (1H, H-5) to 32.2 (C-3) and 174.3 (C-15), and from δH 2.58 (1H, H-3β) to δC 174.3 (C-15) supported the connections of C-4 with C-3, C-5, and C-15. The HMBC correlations from δH 5.27 (1H, H-6) to 79.2 (C-8) and 41.4 (C-11), and from δH 2.62 (1H, H-7) to δC 151.4 (C-5), 79.2 (C-8) and 13.5 (C-13) supported the connections of C-7 with C-6, C-8, and C-11. The HMBC correlations from δH 1.25 (1H, H-14) to 66.9 (C-1), 44.4 (C-9) and 58.8 (C-10), and from δH 3.73 (1H, H-2) to δC 58.8 (C-10) supported the direct linkages of C-10 with C-1, C-9 and C-14. The HMBC correlations from δH 1.40 (1H, H-13) to 178.0 (C-12) supported C-11 linked with the carboxyl carbon C-12. The HMBC correlations from H-6 to C-15 and from δH 4.64 (1H, H-8) to C-12 supported the ester bond linkages of C-6 with C-15 and of C-8 with C-12, respectively. Those above spectral data and literature precedents supported 1 to be a germacrane sesquiterpene dilactone [19,24]. Careful comparison indicated that the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 1 closely resembled those of a previously reported known germacrane sesquiterpenoid 1,10-epoxy-4-germacrene-12,8;15,6-diolide [16], except that the resonances for the methylene group at C-2 in the known compound were absent in 1. Instead, additional signals for an oxygenated methine group [δH 3.73 (1H, H-2); δC 66.9 (C-2)] were exhibited in the spectra. This observation supported that the structure of 1, as shown in Figure 1, was close to 1,10-epoxy-4-germacrene-12,8;15,6-diolide with the only difference that one more hydroxy group attached at C-2 in 1. This deduction was in complete accord with the molecular formula of 1 and the β-orientation of the hydroxy group at C-2 was supported by the observed large coupling constant of H-1 with H-2 (JH-1β,H-2α = 11.7 Hz) [19]. Moreover, the β-orientation of the 2-hydroxy group was further well evidenced by the NOESY spectrum, in which significant NOE correlation signals of H-2 with Me-14, but not H-2 with H-1β, were observed (Figure 3). Therefore, the structure of compound 1 was identified as 2β-hydroxyl-11β,13-dihydrodeoxymikanolide, trivially named dihydrodeoxymikanolide M. [/INST],\n",

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed signals readily recognized for two methyl groups at δH 1.40 (3H, d, Me-13) and 1.19 (3H, s, Me-14), one olefinic methine at δH 7.81 (1H, H-5), and four oxymethines at δ H 3.07 (1H, dd, H-1), 4.88 (1H, dd, H-3), 5.33 (1H, H-6) and 4.57 (1H, ddd, H-8). The 13C NMR data (Table 1) supported the above analysis, which showed fifteen carbon signals including two methyls at δC 13.5 (C-13) and 20.6 (C-14), two methylenes, seven methines (including one olefinic methine at δC 147.8 (C-5) and four oxygenated methines at δC 60.2 (C-1), 65.8 (C-3), 81.8 (C-6), and 79.5 (C-8)), one oxygenated quaternary carbon at δC 58.5 (C-10), and two carboxyl carbon at δC 178.1 (C-12) and 172.6 (C-15). The closely resembled NMR spectral data (Table 1 and Table 2) of 2 with those of 1 supported 2 also being a germacrane sesquiterpene dilactone close to 1. Detailed comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra revealed that the signals for the hydroxy-methine group at C-2 and the methylene group at C-3 in 1 were replaced by signals for a new methylene group (δH 1.75 (1H, ddd, H-2α), 2.17 (1H, ddd, H-2β); δC 32.8 (C-2)) and a new oxymethine group (δH 4.88 (1H, dd, H-3); δC 65.8 (C-3)), respectively. This observation indicated the difference between the two compounds that the hydroxy group located at C-2 in 1 was changed to attach at C-3 in 2. The rationality for assigning the hydroxy group at C-3 in 2 was supported by observation of significant HMBC correlations from δH 7.81 (1H, H-5) to δC 65.8 (C-3) (Figure 3), and accurately interpreted the significant chemical shift change of C-4 and C-5 from δC 131.1 (C-4) and 151.4 (C-5) in 1 to δC 138.0 (C-4) and 147.8 (C-5) in 2, respectively. Furthermore, the β-orientation of the hydroxy group at C-3 was supported by the observed small coupling constants of H-3 with H-2 (JH-3α,H-2α = 4.0 Hz and JH-3α,H-2β = 2.2 Hz) [19] and further well evidenced by the NOESY spectrum, in which significant NOE correlations of H-3 with H2-2, but no NOE correlation of H-3 with H-1, were displayed (Figure 3). Moreover, compound 2 showed closely similar chemical shift values and proton coupling constants from C-6 through C-14 (Table 1 and Table 2) to those of 1, which indicated that the other part structure and relative configurations (from C-6 through C-14) of 2 was the same as that of 1. Thus, compound 2 was identified as 3β-hydroxyl-11β,13-dihydrodeoxymikanolide, trivially named dihydrodeoxymikanolide N, and all the other spectroscopic data supported this deduction. [/INST],\n",

Dry dichloromethane (15 mL) and dry THF (5 mL) were added to dissolve the acid, and finally 5 drops of DMF were added. Under stirring, oxalyl chloride (4.22 × 10−3 mol, 0.36 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction was left for 1.5 h at about 5 °C, then 30 min at room temperature. In parallel, in a 100 mL flask, a solution of curcumin (7.91 × 10−4 mol, 0.29 g), 10 mL of dry THF and triethylamine (7.91 × 10−3 mol, 1.1 mL) was prepared. Using a syringe, the fatty acid chloride solution was transferred and added dropwise to the curcumin solution via septum. The reaction was then left stirring for 24 h, under an inert atmosphere. After this point, 30 mL of distilled water and 45 mL of dichloromethane were added and the reaction mixture was extracted with 1M sodium bicarbonate solution (4×) and with brine (2×). The reaction crude product was then dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate followed by a chromatographic column on silica gel, using a 4:1 mixture of n-hexane:ethyl acetate as eluent to separate unreacted acid and other impurities. Next, crude product was eluted with dichloromethane and precipitated by addition of n-hexane. After filtration, washing with n-hexane (200 mL), and drying under vacuum, the curcumin ester 2 was isolated with a 50% yield (0.36 g). 1H NMR (400 MHz; CDCl3): δH, ppm: 7.62 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 2H), 7.16 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.12 (s, 2H), 7.05 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 6.56 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 2H), 5.86 (s, 1H), 3.87 (s, 6H), 2.58 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 4H), 1.78 (m, 4H), 1.42 (m, 4H), 1.26 (m, ~52H), 0.88 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 6H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δC, ppm: 183.3; 171.8, 151.6, 141.6, 140.2, 134.0, 124.3, 123.5, 121.3, 111.6, 101.9, 56.1, 34.2, 32.1, 29.8, 29.8, 29.8, 29.7, 29.5, 29.4, 29.2, 25.2, 22.8, 14.3; ESI-MS (m/z): calcd for C57H89O8 = 901.6557, found for [M+H]+ = 901.4171; UV-Vis (λmax) in THF: 400 nm, Ɛ: 49,093 M−1 cm−1; M.

Referencing the NMR data and the HRTOFMS data results that showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 459.3844 [M+H]+ (calculated for C30H51O3 at m/z 459.3838), the molecular formula of 2 was established as C30H50O3, with six degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum exhibited hydroxyl (3443 cm–1), C-H stretching of aliphatic carbon (2939 cm–1), ketone (1702 cm–1), gem-dimethyl (1460 and 1386 cm–1), and ether (1040 cm–1) groups. The 13C NMR analysis with the aid of the DEPT and HSQC spectra of 2 (Table 1) showed the presence of a total of thirty carbon signals, which were assigned as eight methyls, nine methylenes, six methines (involving one olefinic and one oxygenated carbon), and seven quaternary carbons (including one olefinic and two oxygenated carbons), together with the aid of DEPT and HSQC spectra. The above data suggested that 2 is an onoceranoid-type triterpenoid [7]. The presence of one double-bond pair and one carbonyl ketone accounted for two degrees of unsaturation, leaving four degrees of unsaturation for the four-rings core of 2. In the 1H NMR spectrum, eight tertiary methyls at δH (ppm) 1.09 (3H, Me-23), 1.04 (3H, Me-24), 0.96 (3H, Me-25), 1.76 (3H, Me-26), 1.15 (3H, Me-27), 0.77 (3H, Me-28), 0.99 (3H, Me-29), and 0.75 (3H, Me-30), one olefinic methine at δH 5.40 ppm (2H, brs, H-7), and one oxygenated methine at δH 3.23 ppm (2H, dd, J = 11.5 and 4.0 Hz, H-21) were clearly identified. Detailed analysis of the 2D NMR spectra (1H-1H COSY and HMBC) (Figure 2) defined the structure of 2. The 1H-1H COSY showed correlations of H-1/H-2, H-6/H-7, H-15/H-16/H-17, and H-19/H-20/H-21, confirming an onoceranoid-type triterpene framework [7]. The presence of a ketonic group at C-3 and a hydroxyl methine group at C-21 was verified by the correlations between Me-23/Me-24 to C-3 and Me-29/Me-30 to C-21. Furthermore, the correlations of Me-27 to C-14 and Me-26 to C-7, C-8 revealed the attachment of a hydroxyl in the quaternary carbon at C-14 and the double-bond form at C-7/C-8. A careful analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR indicated that compound 2 was closely related to kokosanolide B [14], with the main difference being the hydroxyl moiety at C-21. The relative configuration of each stereocenter carbon in 2 was determined by an NOESY experiment. The NOESY spectrum showed correlations between H-21/H-17/H-3 and H-28/H-27. According to the biosynthesis of the onoceranoid-type triterpene, the orientation of H-17 is -oriented, which indicates that the H-21 proton has a orientation. Based on this result, it can be concluded that the hydroxyl group at C-21 is α-oriented, while the hydroxyl group at C-14 is -oriented. Thus, compound 2 was elucidated as a new onoceranoid-type triterpene, 14,21α-dihydroxy-onocera-7-en-3-one, and trivially named as kokosanolide F (2). [/INST],\n",

The evaporation of the organic layer gave a concentrated MeOH extract (143.5 g). The crude MeOH extract was partitioned between H2O and n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-BuOH, successively. The EtOAc soluble fraction (10 g) was fractionated by VLC on silica gel using a stepwise gradient of n- hexane-EtOAc 5% to yield eight fractions (I-P). Fraction L (1.38 g) was chromatographed by a silica gel column (n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 4:3:3) to give six fractions (L1–L6). The separation of subfraction L4 (324 mg) by a silica gel column with a stepwise gradient elution of n-hexane-EtOAc 5% gave three subfractions (L4.1–L4.3). Subfraction L4.3 (106 mg) was then purified by a silica gel column (n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 4.5:4:1.5) to yield 3 (9.8 mg). Fraction L was chosen based on TLC profiles because there was a new spot, which indicated the presence of a new compound.  3.3.1.

Given that, the first choice of masking group was 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfonyl group (DNBS), which has often been chosen as the responsive unit for biothiols [48,49,50,51]. Therefore, by modifying the hydroxyl group in the fluorophore, we envisioned that the fluorescence could be totally quenched through blocking intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, thus minimizing background fluorescence interference. Then, by covalently connecting DNBS to fluorophore, we designed and constructed Cy-DNBS. The reaction of biothiols and Cy-DNBS generated Cy-OH and thereby restored the strong absorption and emission at 726 nm, 762 nm, respectively. The detailed synthetic route and recognition mechanism were shown in Scheme 1. Furthermore, the structures of Cy7, Cy-OH and Cy-DNBS were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS), with the details compiled in the supporting information (Figures S10–S19).

The extract was then partitioned with CHCl3 and EtOAc, resulting in CHCl3 (CCS1), EtOAc (CCS2), and H2O (CCS3) fractions. The CHCl3 fraction (CCS1) was further fractionated using a silica gel CC with a gradient of n-hexane:acetone (20:1→1:1, v/v) to give five sub-fractions (CCS1A–CCS1E). The CCS1C fraction was again applied to a silica gel column with CHCl3:MeOH (4:1, v/v) to produce five additional fractions (CCS1C1–CCS1C5). The CCS1C2 fraction yielded 1 (26.4 mg) and 12 (12.8 mg) using preparative HPLC with a J’sphere ODS H-80 column (250 mm × 20 mm), eluted with 20% MeCN in H2O at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Under the same HPLC conditions, the CCS1C3 fraction purified 6 (16.0 mg), 7 (10.6 mg), 8 (13.0 mg), 9 (17.2 mg), and 10 (13.0 mg), while the CCS1C4 fraction purified 2 (9.1 mg), 3 (9.4 mg), 5 (2.8 mg), and 11 (2.7 mg). The EtOAc fraction (CCS2) was fractionated on a silica gel column with a gradient of CHCl3:MeOH (20:1→1:1, v/v), yielding five sub-fractions (CCS2A–CCS2E). The CCS2C fraction was further processed on a YMC RP-18 column with MeOH:H2O (2:1, v/v) to produce two smaller fractions (CCS2C1 and CCS2C2).

DHA is an antimalarial drug and has been reported to exert anticancer activities against various cancers but a short half-life limits further clinical applications. In this study, we found that UDCMe-Z-DHA, a hybrid of UDCMe and DHA via a triazole linkage, was ~23 times and ~4 times more potent than DHA in HepG2 cells and Huh-7 cells, respectively, in part due to increased stability. In addition, UDCMe-Z-DHA was much less toxic to normal cells. UDCMe-Z-DHA induced G0/G1 arrest, ROS, MMP loss and autophagy, which may subsequently lead to apoptosis. Thus, UDCMe-Z-DHA may be a potential drug candidate for HCC.

The 13C-NMR showed six carbon signals of glucose, δC 97.65, 73.35, 71.35, 70.13, 69.47, and 65.48 (see Table 4). The 1H NMR showed a terminal proton signal δH 4.96 (J = 2.5 Hz) in Table 4. Therefore, the conformation of glucose was determined to be α-type by the correlation between proton coupling constant. By analyzing the HMBC, we could see that H-1 was related to C-6, suggesting that the connection mode of the polysaccharide was 1 → 6 (see Fig. 12) 37,38.Figure 8 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of CPP 2–4.

Sodium hydroxide (26.40 g) was added under vigorous stirring. A solution of acryloyl chloride (53.70 mL) in THF (50 mL) was slowly injected into the flask. The pH was maintained at 7.5–7.8. After stirring for 8 h, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The retained aqueous phase was acidified to pH ≈ 2.0 with 6 mol L−1 HCl and then extracted again with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried with anhydrous MgSO4 overnight. After filtration, it was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure and then precipitated in an excess of petroleum ether.

Preparation of CS/PACG Composite Hydrogels and DN Hydrogels  The CS/PACG composite hydrogels were prepared by photo‐initiated radical polymerization. Briefly, ACG (0.60 g), CS (0.04, 0.07, and 0.19 g), MBA solution (21.49 µL, 0.03 mol% of ACG monomers, C MBA = 10 mg mL−1) and Irgacure 2959 (0.01 g, 1 mol% of ACG monomers) were dissolved in deionized water (4 mL). The mixture was cast into desired molds and radiated under UV radiation (150 W) for 2 h. Subsequently, the CS1.6/PACG composite hydrogel were soaked in different salt solutions for a predetermined time to prepare various CS/PACG DN hydrogels.  Structural Characterizations 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 400 or Bruker Avance III 400 HD NMR spectrometer using DMSO‐d6 as solvent. Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken on a TENSOR‐27 spectrometer. The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by an Empyrean diffractometer with a scan rate of 4° min−1 and scan range from 3–80°. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired from a JSM‐6700F microscope.  Swelling Ratio of the Hydrogels [/INST],\n",

After the dissolution of the mixture, zinc dust was added (7.8 g, 119 mmol, 10 equiv) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The resulting mixture was filtered through a small pad of Celite with AcOH. The organic phase was extracted with CH2Cl2, washed with HCl (1 M) and brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered off, and concentrated in vacuo. The purification of the residue was performed on an automatic combi flash chromatography (Petroleum ether: Acetone + 1% HCOOH; silicagel column Buchi Flashpure 120 g; 0% to 10% acetone over 20 min, then 10% to 11.3% acetone over 5.1 min, isocratic for 22.7 min, and 11.3 to 20% acetone over 10.4 min (total 58.2 min)).

Its 1H NMR spectrum (CD3OD) revealed the presence of one typical aromatic ABX spin system with signals at δH 7.16 (1H, d, J = 1.9 Hz, H-2), 7.04 (1H, dd, J = 8.4, 1.9 Hz, H-6), and 6.78 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-5), as well as one trans double bond with signals at δH 7.53 (1H, d, J = 15.8 Hz, H-7) and 6.32 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-8). A connection between H-2 and H-7 was confirmed by HMBC correlation from δH 7.53 (H-7) to δC 111.3 (C-2). Additionally, hydoroxyl and methoxyl group positions were confirmed by the following HMBC correlations: H-7/C-2, H-2, and H-6/C-4, and H-5 and H-10/C3, respectively (Supplementary Materials, Figure S9). Thus, the structure of compound 1, ferulic acid, was identified based on spectroscopic analyses and comparison of spectroscopic data with the reported compound [29]. The 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR spectra of compound 1 are included in Supplementary Materials (Figures S10–S13).

Solvents were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and Fisher Scientific, and used without further purification. Substrates and reagents were purchased from Alfa Aesar, Fisher Scientific, Fluorochem, or Sigma–Aldrich, and used as received. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with 400 and 500 MHz instruments and are reported relative to residual solvent: CHCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded with the same instruments (100 and 125 MHz) and again are reported relative to CHCl3 (δ = 77.16 ppm). Data reported for 1H NMR are as follows: chemical shift (δ/ppm) (multiplicity, coupling constant (Hz), integration). Multiplicities are reported as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, p = pentet, h = heptet, m = multiplet. Data for 13C{1H} NMR are reported in terms of chemical shift (δ/ppm) and multiplicity (C, CH, CH2, or CH3). COSY, HSQC and HMBC, experiments were used in the structural assignment. IR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Platinum spectrophotometer (neat, ATR sampling) with the intensities of the characteristic signals being reported as weak (w, <20% of the tallest signal), medium (m, 21−70% of the tallest signal), or strong (s, >71% of the tallest signal). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed using the indicated techniques with a micromass LCT orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer with leucine-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Phe-Leu) as an internal lock mass. For UV/Vis measurements, a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV spectrophotometer was used. Continuous-flow experiments were performed with a Vapourtec E-Series system equipped with a UV150 photoreactor in combination with a high-power LED emitting light at 365 nm wavelength and a medium-pressure Hg-lamp (combined with a low-pass filter).  5.

Its molecular formula, C15H22O2, was established by positive HRESIMS (m/z 235.1694 [M + H]+, calculated 235.1693), with an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHDs) of five. The UV spectrum exhibited an absorption maximum of 235.7 nm (Figure S1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals for two double bonds, which included three hydrogen signals at δH 5.88 (1H, s), δH 5.72 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 1.0), and δH 5.56 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 1.0); three methylenes at δH 2.25 (2H, d, J = 11.0), δHa 1.92 (1H, m) and δHb 1.74 (1H, m) and at δHa 1.61 (1H, m) and δHb 1.40 (1H, m); and four methyls at δH 1.34 (3H, s), δH 1.28 (3H, s), δH 1.26 (3H, s), and δH 1.10 (3H, s) in the 1H NMR spectrum as well as active hydrogen signals at δH 4.55 (1H, s). The 13C-NMR and DEPT spectra (Table 1) showed carbon signals corresponding to the chemical units described above and confirmed their presence. These resonances included one ketone carbon (δC 206.8), three olefinic carbons (δC 135.1, δC 132.9, and δC 129.3), and three odd numbers, which indicated that δC 193.5 prefers one olefinic carbon, not to a ketone carbon; three quaternary carbons (δC 66.2, δC 44.9, and δC 41.4), three methines (δC 54.8, δC 35.3 and δC 34.3), and four methyl carbons (δC 29.9, δC 29.5, δC 29.4, and δC 28.5). In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 2), correlations of H-2 (δH 5.88) to C-4 (δC 44.9), C-5 (δC 54.8), and C-1 (δC 206.8) and from H-5 (δH 2.25) to C-1 (δC 206.8) and C-3 (δC 193.5), suggesting that a cyclopentenone (ring A) was formed by C-1, C-2 (δC 129.3), C-3, C-4, and C-5; a cyclohexene ring (ring B) formed by C-1′ (δC 41.4), C-2′ (δC 132.9), C-3′ (δC 135.1), C-4′ (δC 66.2), C-5′ (δC 35.3), and C-6′ (δC 34.3) was readily furnished by the 1H-1H COSY correlations (Figure 2) of H-2′ (δH 5.72)/H-3′ (δH 5.56) and H-5′ (δH 1.61, 1.40)/H-6′ (δH 1.92, 1.72), in combination with HMBC correlations of H-2′, H-3′, H-5′ (δH 1.61, 1.40) and H-6′ (δH 1.92, 1.74) to C-1′ and C-4′. HMBC correlations of H-6 (δH 1.34) and H-7 (δH 1.26) with C-3 and C-5, H-7′ (δH 1.28) with C-3 and C-2′, and H-8′ (δH 1.10) with C-3′ and C-5′, which indicated four methyl positions, as depicted in Figure 2, respectively. The relative configuration was further deduced from ROESY data (Figure 2). Key correlations between H-7′ and H-8′ suggested that H-7′ and H-8′ were on the same face of ring B. Therefore, a pair of enantiomers of 1′S′, 4′R′ was possible for the relative configuration of compound 2. The relative configuration of compound 2 was established as 1′S, 4′R, and named Indusiataine B. [/INST],\n",

As reported in SI Figure S2, in 13C-NMR analysis of Alg-Tyr-3APBA, a peak at δ = 174 ppm appears, related to the formation of the amide group which is, as expected, totally absent in sodium alginate spectra [31]. The peak at δ = 175 ppm is instead related to the carboxyl group, and it is present in both compounds. This means that the polymer is not completely functionalized which agrees with the relatively low DOF% values calculated from 1H-NMR. Moreover, in Alg-Tyr-3APBA are visible peaks at δ = 130 ppm and at δ = 115 ppm which are related to the orto and meta carbon of the aromatic ring of tyramine adduct [32]. In the range δ = 128–135 ppm are visible the peaks related to the carbon atoms of aromatic ring of phenyl boronic acid adduct [27]. Figure 1 also reports the spectrum of alginate functionalized only with tyramine. Aromatic protons of tyramine were visible in the range of δ = 6.8–7.2 ppm [30] and the degree of functionalization was 5.5%. [/INST],\n",

Its molecular formula of C15H13Cl2NO4 was established by HRESIMS (m/z 340.0142 [M-H]−, calculated for C15H12Cl2NO4 340.0143), suggesting nine indices of hydrogen deficiency and the substitution of a proton with a chlorine atom compare to 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 exhibited signals of an aromatic singlet proton at δH 6.25 (s, H-5); a pyrrole proton at δH 5.95 (s, H-3); a methine proton at δH 1.97 (m, H-2′); a methylene signal at δH 2.50 (d, J = 7.3, 2H, H2-1′); and two methyl groups at δH 0.91 (d, J = 6.7, 6H, H3-3′ and H3-4′). The 13C NMR in combination with the HSQC spectrum of 2 exhibited the presence of a carbonyl group at δC 160.9 (C-9); eight non-protonated carbons at δC 93.5 (C-8a), 105.1 (C-1); 113.0 (C-7), 117.3 (C-2), 141.7 (C-3a), 154.5 (C-4a), 161.6 (C-8), and 166.3 (C-6); two aromatic protonated carbons at δC 90.3 (C-3) and 94.1 (C-5); a methine at δC 29.1 (C-2′); a methylene at δC 32.0 (C-1′); and two methyl carbons at δC 22.9 (2 C, C-3′ and C-4′) (Table 1). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 were similar to those of 1, except for the absence of a proton signal at the C-1 position. H-3 of 2 existed in a singlet, while the meta-coupling signal for H-l was missing. Comparing the HMBC correlations of 1 and 2, the absence of HMBC correlations from H-1 to C-2, C-3, C-3a, and C-9 in 2 indicated that 2 is a di-chlorine-substituted analog of 1 at the C-1 position (Figure 2).

The 1H and 13C NMR (Table 1) spectrum showed a secondary methyl signal at δH 1.26 (3H, d, J = 6.4 Hz, H-10), three tertiary methyl signals at δH 0.87 (3H, s, H-12), δH 1.11 (3H, s, H-13) and δH 1.21 (3H, s, H-11), two methylene signals at δH 1.59 (1H, ddd, J = 12.3, 4.3, 2.1 Hz, H-2), δH 1.75 (1H, tt, J = 12.2, H-2) and δH 1.87 (1H, m, H-4), δH 1.96 (1H, ddd, J = 13.3, 4.3, 2.2 Hz, H-4), two secondary carbinyl proton signals at δH 6.04 (1H, dd, J = 15.8, 1.3 Hz, H-7) and δH 5.78 (1H, dd, J = 15.8, 6.4 Hz, H-8), two set glucosyl anomeric protons [δH 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1′) and δH 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1″)]. In addition to the signals due to the above functional groups, the spectrum showed signals due to a quaternary carbon atom at 40.8 and two quaternary carbon atoms with an oxygen atom at δC 77.8, 79.1. The side chain structure was confirmed by the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-10/H-9, H-9/H-8, and H-8/H-7. Furthermore, according to the HMBC correlations of H-11/C-1, C-2, H-12/C-1, C-6, H-2/C-4, C-6, H-4/C-5, H-13/C-4, and C-6, the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-2/H-3, H3/H-4 and the NOESY correlations of H-2 (δH 1.59)/H-3 (δH 4.21), H-11 (δH 1.21)/H-2 (δH 1.59), H-3 (δH 4.21), H-7 (δH 6.04), H-12 (δH 0.87)/H-8 (δH 5.78) and H-13 (δH 1.11)/H-7 (δH 6.04), compound 1 was presumed to have a structure with a megastigm-7-ene carbon skeleton to which four hydroxyl groups are introduced on C-3, 5, 6 and 9. Further in HMBC (Figure 2), the correlation between H-1′ [δH 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz)] with C-3 (δC 74.2) suggested that one β-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-3 position of the cycle. Correlations of HMBC from H-1″ [δH 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz)] with C-2′ (δC 83.7) and H-2′ [δH 3.36 (1H, m)] with C-1″ (δC 105.6) indicated that another β-glucosyl moiety was attached at the C-2′ position. To determine the absolute stereochemistry, compound 1 was subjected to the Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAO) method [11,12,13]. Compound 1 was represented at the mPW1PW91/6-31G(d) level two isomers 1a (3R, 5S, 6S, 9R) and 1b (3S, 5R, 6R, 9S) using Gaussian quantum chemistry NMR calculations and DP4+ probabilistic analysis. The results show that the configuration of 1a (3R, 5S, 6S, 9R) is more consistent with the experimental value of 1 (Figure 3) and has 99.96% DP4+ probability (Show in Supplementary Materials). Thus, the absolute configuration of compound 1 is confirmed and named as thesiumin A. [/INST],\n",

The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 showed the signals of two sets of methylene protons [δH 2.71(2H, t, J = 7.1 Hz, H-7) and δH 3.69 (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8)], an ABX aromatic system proton [δH 7.15(1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2), δH 6.76 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, H-5) and δH 6.80 (1H, d, J = 2.0, 8.1 Hz, H-6)], and two sets of glucosyl anomeric protons [δH 4.78 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1′) and δH 4.74 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1″)], which indicated the presence of 3,4- dihydroxyphenyl alcohol and two glucose units. Further comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 with 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl alcohol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (6) [14] suggested that compound 2 contained one more glucose unit than 6. In HMBC (Figure 4), the correlation between H-1′ [δH 4.78 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz)] with C-3 (δC 146.7) suggested one β-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-3 position of the aromatic cycle.

The 1H NMR data (Table 1, Figure S9) of 2 show one methyl [δH 1.24 (3H, s, H-11)], four methylenes [δH 3.94 (1H, d, J = 11.2 Hz, Ha-10), 3.69 (1H, d, J = 11.2 Hz, Hb-10), 1.62-1.91 (4H, m, H2-4, H2-5), δH 3.49 (2H, br d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-2′)], and five methines [δH 8.71 (1H, s, H-6′), 7.26 (1H, s, H-4′), 4.97 (1H, br t, J = 7.4 Hz, H-1′), δH 4.46 (1H, br d, J = 4.6 Hz, H-3), 4.36 (1H, br d, J = 4.8 Hz, H-6)]. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra (Table 2, Figure S10) show 16 carbon signals, which were assigned as one methyl, four methylenes, five methines, and six non-protonated carbons (including 2 carbonyls and 1 carboxyl). These featured NMR signals are similar to those of canthaminomide F [11], suggesting that 2 is a 1-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl cantharimide-type derivative. The key difference is that the substitution of a methyl at C-1 is replaced by a hydroxymethyl, which is supported by the HMBC correlations of H2-10/C-2, C-6, and C-7 (Figure 2, Figure S12). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was assigned. The ROESY correlations between H-3 (δH 4.46), H2-10 (δH 3.69)/H3-11 (δH 1.24), and between H2-10 (δH 3.94)/H-6 (δH 4.36) suggested that 2 possesses the same relative configuration as compound 1 in the counterpart (Figure 3, Figure S14). The resolution of the configuration at C-1′ has been reported in previous literature [11], and the same method was used to determine the configuration of compound 2. The D or L-histidine was, respectively, submitted to a reaction containing compound 5 under 95% EtOH of solvent at 78 °C for 48 h, which led to the generation of 2a (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′R)/2b (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′S) (Supplementary Materials, Scheme S1). A careful comparison of the NMR data and the retention time in the HPLC chromatogram of 2a and 2b with those of compound 2 revealed that 2a is actually the same as 2 (Supplementary Materials, Figures S41–S45). Thus, the absolute configuration of 2 at C-1′ was assigned. With this information in hand, the absolute configurations at the rest chiral carbons of 2 were solved by comparison of the theoretical and experimental ECD spectra (Figure 4, Figure S16). The results showed that the calculated ECD spectrum of (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′R)-2 is in good accordance with that of 2. Thus, the structure of 2 was determined to be [(1R,2R,3S,6R,1′R)- 1-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-3,6-epoxycyclohexane-1,2-dicarboximide]-(1′R)-histidine and named cichormide B. [/INST],\n",

The IR spectrum of 1 featured typical absorption bands for hydroxyl (3413 cm−1) and conjugated ketone (1670 cm−1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1 revealed two methyls (δH 2.26 and δH 2.31), one methoxy (δH 3.70), two oxymethines (δH 6.38 and δH 6.83), one aldehyde proton (δH 10.34), and one hydroxyl proton (δH 11.33). The 13C NMR (Table 2) and DEPT spectra showed 19 well-resolved carbon atom signals, including one ketone carbonyl (δC 196.9), one aldehydic carbonyl (δC 191.2), two oxygenated tertiary carbons (δC 89.8 and δC 68.6), one methoxy carbon (δC 60.2), two methyls (δC 11.8 and δC 10.2), and twelve olefinic quaternary carbons at δC 156.9−104.5, accounting for 8 degrees of unsaturation. Thus, compound 1 was thought to possess a tetracyclic skeleton. The strong heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) correlations from H-17 (δH 2.31) to C-12 (δC 121.7), C-13 (δC 121.9), and C-14 (δC 144.3), from H-18 (δH 10.34) to C-11 (δC 112.6), C-12, C-13, and C-14, as well as the weak signals from H-17 to C-11, C-15 (δC 138.4), and C-16 (δC 135.8) confirmed the existence of ring A (Figure 2). The HMBC correlations from H-19 (δH 2.26) to C-3 (δC 130.8), C-4 (δC 115.8), and C-5 (δC 156.9), as well as the HMBC correlations from 7-OH (δH 11.33) to C-6, C-7 (δC 153.6), and C-8 (δC 104.5) established the substitution of the aromatic ring D. Furthermore, the HMBC correlations from H-2 (δH 6.83) to C-10 (δC 68.6) and C-16, from H-10 (δH 6.38) to C-2 (δC 89.8), C-11, C-12 and C-16 suggested the presence of two oxygen bridges between C-16/C-2 and C-2/C-10 in ring B, which could be confirmed by the low field chemical shift signal of CH-2 (δC 89.8, δH 6.83). Ring C was established by the HMBC correlations from H-2 to C-4 and C-8, and from H-10 to C-8 and C-9 (δC 196.9). The comprehensive NMR analysis indicated that 1 shared the same oxygen-bridged skeleton with epicocconigrone A (4) [24], with the exception that the appearance of 6-OCH3 in 1 replaced 6-OH in 4, which was supported by the HMBC correlation from 6-OCH3 (δH 3.70) to C-6 (δC 134.7). Thus, the planar structure of 1 was elucidated as shown (Figure 1), named epicocconigrone C. In the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum of 1, the correlation between H-2 and H-10 was indicative of their cis relationship (Figure 2). The absolute configuration of 1 was confirmed by the ECD calculation. Its experimental ECD curve for the absolute configurations of 2S and 10R was consistent with the calculated ECD curve of (2S, 10R) (Figure 3). [/INST],\n",

The IR spectrum of 2 featured typical absorption bands for hydroxyl (3446 cm−1) and conjugated ketone (1626 cm−1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 indicated two methyl groups (δH 2.09 and δH 2.18), two methoxy groups (δH 3.57 and δH 3.69), one methylene (δH 4.32, d, J = 12.1 Hz; 4.81 d, J = 12.1 Hz), two oxymethines (δH 5.65 and δH 6.76), and two hydroxyl protons (δH 8.92 and δH 11.46). The 13C NMR (Table 2) and DEPT spectra revealed 20 carbon atom signals, including one ketone carbonyl (δC 196.8), two oxygenated tertiary carbons (δC 89.9 and δC 70.3), two methoxy carbons (δC 60.3 and δC 60.0), one methylene (δC 55.8), two methyls (δC 11.0 and δC 10.3), and twelve olefinic quaternary carbons. Detailed analysis of 2D NMR spectra of 2 revealed that it had a similar structure to 1. The major differences in 2 were a hydroxymethylene group and a methoxy group substituted at C-12 and C-15, instead of the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group, respectively, when compared to 1 (Figure 2), which were further confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H2-18 (δH 4.32, 4.81) to C-11 (δC 108.3), C-12 (δC 132.1), and C-13 (δC 118.1), and from 15-OCH3 (δH 3.69) to C-15 (δC 134.6). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was elucidated as shown (Figure 1), named epicocconigrone D. The ROESY correlation between H-2 and H-10 indicated their cis orientation (Figure 2).

This is the first Acremonium-derived bazzanane-type sesquiterpenoid isolated with chemical-structure modifications, such as chlorination and amination. Marinobazzanan (1) was shown to inhibit cancer-cell migration and invasion at non-toxic concentrations of 1, 2.5, and 5 µM and downregulate the transcription factors Snail, Slug, and Twist. In addition, marinobazzanan (1) decreased cell motility by downregulating the expression level of KITENIN while upregulating that of KAI1. Furthermore, the new compound modulated the expression of β-catenin by downregulating downstream target genes. Marinobazzanan (1) was also shown to have a reduced number of metastatic nodules in an intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model. Together, these findings suggest that 1 exhibits potent anticancer activity against cancer cells in vitro and anti-cancer activity for the peritoneal carcinomatosis model in vivo.

The solution was poured into a mixture of 5% aqueous HCl (3 L) and ice, stirred until the ice melted and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 1 L). The combined organic phases were washed with H2O (2 × 500 mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Traces of pyridine were removed by co-evaporation with toluene (2 × 500 mL).

The UV (Figure S12) absorption maxima of 2 at 196 nm indicated the presence of double bands, while the IR spectra (Figure S13) revealed the presence of hydroxy and carbonyl functionalities; the chemical structure of 2 was displayed in Figure 1. In an analysis of 1H NMR (Figure S14), 13C NMR, and DEPT spectra (Figure S15), the 1D NMR data (see Table 1) were very similar to those of 1 except for the difference of another long-chain saturated fatty acid ester unit, This assumption was supported by the signals at δC 175.0, 35.1, 32.7, 30.2–30.8, 26.0, 23.7, 14.5 and δH 2.32 (2H, d, J = 7.3 Hz), 1.60 (2H, m), 0.90 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz).

Briefly, a Co(en)3Cl3 complex (en = ethylenediamine) was isolated first and used as a template in the following step, in which it was reacted with formaldehyde and nitromethane in an ice-cold basic medium. The template-directed condensation involves all six N-atoms in the octahedron’s vertices of the Co(en)3Cl3 complex, thereby forming the bicyclic cage structure of Co(diNO2Sar)Cl3 (diNO2Sar = dinitrosarcophagine, or 1,8-dinitro-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo-(6,6,6)eicosane). The latter was precipitated via the addition of 6N HCl and isolated as orange crystals. Its reduction to the diamino-analogue Co(DiAmSar)Cl3 was performed under nitrogen with an excess of Zn powder and concentrated HCl. To avoid the isolation of the mixture of Co(III) and Co(II) complexes, of which the latter is not stable in air, the formed product was oxidized to Co(III) with H2O2. The resulting product mixture of differently protonated amines was separated by column chromatography with the cation exchange resin Dowex 50WX2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) to allow for the isolation of the doubly protonated Co(DiAmSarH2)Cl5 via elution with 3M HCl. Yellow crystals were isolated after the concentration of the eluate. The removal of the Co(III) ion from the bicyclic cage was performed with an excess of cobaltous cyanide (formed in situ) and sodium cyanide under nitrogen. The metal-free DiAmSar was extracted with boiling acetonitrile from the dry residue of the evaporated reaction mixture. White crystals were collected after recrystallization from a minimal amount of acetonitrile.  1H-NMR (δ (ppm), DMSO-d6): 2.61 (s, 6H); 2.62 (s, 6H); 3.09 (bs, 10H, NH, NH2). 13C-NMR (δ (ppm), DMSO-d6): 50.00; 55.34; 58.64.

The mixture was stirred at 0 °C in an ice bath. A cold solution of sodium nitrite (1.2 mmol, 82.8 mg in 1 mL of water) was added dropwise to produce the diazonium salt solution. The temperature of the solution was kept at 0 °C. Then, a solution of ethyl cyanoacetate (135.74 mg,1.2 mmol) and sodium acetate ((1 g), dissolved in 5 mL water) was added dropwise into the diazonium salt solution. The mixture was kept at 0 °C overnight. The resulting solution was neutralised with sodium carbonate to produce a yellow solid, which was washed with water.

Its molecular formula, C28H30O8, was determined from (+)-HRESIMS ion peak at m/z 477.1931 [M+H-H2O]+ (calcd. for C28H29O7 477.1913). The 1H NMR spectra displayed a singlet for the deshielded aromatic proton at ẟH 8.51 (1H, s, H-1) and a doublet for the hemiketal proton at ẟH 6.20 (1H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), which together with the two methoxy singlet protons at ẟH 3.78 (3H, s) and 3.80 (3H, s) suggested that the structure 3 was similar to that of 6-hydroxy-2,3,9-trimethoxy-[1]-benzopyrano [3,4-b][1]benzopyran-12(6H)-one (rotenoid) [23,24]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 2) supported the presence of the rotenoid skeleton as it exhibited signals at ẟC155.8 (C-6a), 110.1 (C-12a), and 88.7 (C-6). In addition, 1H NMR and 1H-1H COSY spectra of 3 exhibited an ABX system formed by signals at ẟH 7.13 (1H, dd, J = 8.9, 2.4 Hz, H-10), ẟH 7.24 (1H, d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-8) and ẟH 8.07 (1H, d, J = 8.9 Hz, H-11). The ABX system was clearly located on the D-ring, due to the deshielded value of H-11 induced by the anisotropic effect of the carbonyl C-12. Moreover, the 1H NMR spectrum displayed one more singlet for aromatic proton at ẟH 6.73 (1H, s), which according to the multiplicity was unequivocally located in a para position of H-1. Furthermore, a geraniol side chain attached was evident in compound 3 from the 1H and 13C NMR signals at δ 1.17 (6H, s), 1.73 (1H, dd, J = 1.3 Hz), 4.73 (2H, m, J = 6.5 Hz), 2.74 (2H, d, J = 6.7Hz), 5.50 (t), 5.53 (m), and 5.61 (dt), and a hydroxyl signal at δ 4.49 (Table 2) and also from the HRESIMS in which a fragment ion at m/z 153 was observed. The geraniol was evidenced at C-9 by the HMBC correlations depicted between H-11 (ẟH 8.07), oxymethylene H-1′ (ẟH 4,73), and carbon C-9 (ẟc 163.6), whereas the positions of the two methoxys were deduced from the para coupled protons H-1 and H-4, further supported by the HMBC correlations between -OCH3-2 (ẟH 3.78), H-1 (ẟH 8.51), and carbon C-2 (ẟC 143.9), and then between -OCH3-3 (ẟH 3.80), H-4 (ẟH 6.73), and C-3 (ẟC 149.8). Compound 3 exhibited [α]D = 0, thus, we propose it is racemic at the single chiral center, C-6. On the basis of the above spectroscopic studies, compound 3 was established as 6-hydroxy-9-(((2E,5E)-7-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylocta-2,5-dien-1-yl) oxy)-2,3-dimethoxy-[1]-benzopyrano [3,4-b[1] benzopyran-12(6H)-one, trivially named Stuhlmarotenoid A.

In brief, indole was reacted with pentyl bromide and potassium hydroxide in DMF. The obtained N-pentylindole was acylated with 1-naphthoyl chloride in the presence of Me2AlCl in dichloromethane to produce JWH-018. The structure was confirmed by the following spectroscopic analyses: 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.52-8.48 (m, 1H), 8.20 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1H), 7.95 (t, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 7.90 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (dd, J = 6.9, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 7.54-7.45 (m, 3H), 7.40-7.35 (m, 4H), 4.05 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 1.82-1.76 (m, 2H), 1.32-1.22 (m, 4H), 0.85 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H); 13C-NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ 192.1, 139.2, 138.1, 137.1, 133.8, 130.9, 130.1, 128.3, 127.1, 126.8, 126.4, 126.1, 125.9, 124.7, 123.7, 123.0, 122.9, 117.6, 110.1, 47.3, 29.6, 29.0, 22.3, 14.0; HR-MS calculated for C24H23NO [M + H]+ 342.1852, found 342.1852; HPLC purity 99.46%.

JWH-018 was selected as it has been used in several early cannabinoid-based studies, and the dose was selected based on reports that demonstrated significant addiction-related effects of JWH-018 and other cannabinoids in rodents (de Luca et al., 2015; Ossato et al., 2017).  2.3 Behavioral tests [/INST],\n",

The SNAPicillin product readily precipitated as a green substrate (Figure 2A). Key functional groups on SNAPicillin were verified via FTIR (Figure 2B) and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures 2C and S1). FTIR analyses of the isolated SNAPicillin product showed the emergence of several bands characteristic of the NO donor precursor, NAP, as well as N=O stretching vibrations characteristic of RSNOs (1497 cm–1). Further 1H NMR studies of the isolated SNAPicillin supported aminolysis of NAPTH with ampicillin’s amine via evidence of ring-opening and the presence of several distinct hydrogen environments associated with NAP’s amide group (labels 13 and 14) and its chiral center (label 10, see Figure 2C). 13C NMR studies further supported these findings, showing distinct carbon environment formation in the final isolated product (Figure S1). Finally, further mass spectrometry studies demonstrated two peaks at ∼555.0 and 573.8 m/z ratios, corresponding to decomposed SNAPicillin with released NO as well as pristine SNAPicillin (551.63 g/mol). The solubility of SNAPicillin decreased when compared to its ampicillin precursor in PBS. While ampicillin shows solubility up to ∼50 mg mL–1, SNAPicillin displayed solubility up to ∼5 mg mL–1 utilizing vigorous stirring. However, this is improved upon the SNAP alternative, at ∼2 mg mL–1 in PBS. These enhanced solubility limits for SNAPicillin afford it greater opportunity in aqueous settings than previously possible with SNAP.  Figure 2 SNAPicillin was readily precipitated as (A) a green powder. (B) FTIR characterization of SNAPicillin powder supported the presence of the RSNO group through characteristic bond vibration (1497 cm–1) as well as other characteristic peaks consistent with the NO donor precursor NAP. (C) 1H NMR spectroscopy (400 MHz, CD3OD) of SNAPicillin further demonstrated bond formation and conjugation of NAP to ampicillin. [/INST],\n",

The yellow suspension was stirred for 1 h, then cobalt(ii) chloride (26 mg; 0.203 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for another 16 h. To quench the reaction, water (1 ml) was added. The suspension was filtered through a cotton pad and a porous glass frit. The respective filter cakes were washed with dichloromethane (10 ml) three times. The red solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid (84 mg; 0.126 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (5 ml), and KPF6 (6 equiv.; 140 mg; 0.75 mmol) was added. The compound was precipitated by the addition of water (20 ml) and filtered off. The process was repeated four times to ensure full exchange of the counterion. The suspension was filtered and the light-yellow solid was dried under reduced pressure. It was then dissolved in a minimal amount of acetone and allowed to crystallize under a normal atmosphere. Yellow crystals were obtained (60 mg; 0.0879 mmol; 69% yield). The results of 1H NMR (700 MHz; CD3CN) were δ = 7.72 (d; J = 2.0 Hz; 2H), 7.47 – 7.37 (m; 3H), 6.75 (d; J = 2.0 Hz; 2H) and 2.52 ppm (s, 6H). The results of 13C NMR (706 MHz; CD3CN) were δ = 207.48, 186.44, 177.78, 149.36, 125.14, 118.31, 116.01, 108.12, 35.86, 30.89 and 1.32 ppm. Finally, elemental analysis of [Co(ImP)2][PF6] with one molecule of acetone (C28H26F6CoN8P × C3H6O) gave calculated and found values of 50.55 and 50.49% (C), 4.38 and 4.32% (H) and 15.21 and 15.22% (N), respectively.

Since the discovery of the first NIR‐II dyes, synthetic chemists have primarily focused on designing new molecules with optimal in vivo fluorescence performance and imaging function.[ 24 , 25 , 30 ] The S‐D‐A‐D‐S system incorporates appropriate features to reduce both solvent‐ and aggregation‐induced fluorescence quenchings.[ 33 , 34 , 36 ] For example, in the design of IR‐FEP,[ 33 ] one of the best performers in this series, using 3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as the donor unit afforded a conformational distortion of the conjugated backbone, thereby limiting aggregation‐induced quenching. Alkyl chains on the fluorene shielding unit stretch out of the plane of the conjugated backbone, further limiting the propensity of the molecule to aggregate while also serving as a solvent shield for the core. We adapted this scaffold as the basis for our molecular design in which EDOT and benzobisthiadiazole were maintained as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. To improve the shielding effect of the unit, the alkyl chains on the fluorene were extended from six to eight carbon atoms each. We also appended to each of the fluorene‐shielding units, an N,N‐dialkylaniline moiety bearing functionalized C11 chains as anchors to the solubilizing moieties. Molecular dynamics studies on dilute solutions of sucrose suggest the existence of two hydration shells between the solute and the bulk solvent.[ 37 , 38 ] The first hydration shell spans 2.8–3.7 Å from the solute hydroxyl oxygens, with strong radial water structuring. This structuring is stabilized by inter‐ and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between water and solute hydroxy groups, with each hydroxyl group surrounded by 3.9 to 4.4 nearest neighbors, indicating saturated hydrogen bonding capacity. At the limit of the first hydration shell (3.7 Å), the water density is estimated to decrease to a little more than half of the bulk water density. The second hydration shell has a long‐range structure with a center of 5.5 Å. Taken together, both hydration shells form a substantial shielding effect between the core of the solute and the surrounding bulk water molecules. We reasoned that this shielding phenomenon can be adapted to the S‐D‐A‐D‐S system. The PEGylated variant of the molecule CPK‐03‐37 was accessed in eight linear synthetic steps (Scheme S1.1, Supporting Information). To access the sucrose derivative XW‐03‐66, 6f‐azido sucrose was synthesized in five linear synthetic steps and appended to the core structure using click chemistry (Schemes S1.2 and S1.3, Supporting Information). All intermediates and the final structure were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and mass analysis (HRMS or MALDI where appropriate).  2.2 Optical Properties of XW‐03‐66 [/INST],\n",

The NMR characteristics of the complex is consistent with those reported for related Pt(II) complexes (Pazderski et al., 2009). Structural elucidation is depicted in the experimental section. Signals in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra ( Figure 3 ) were observed with the expected chemical shifts and assignment was performed based on 2D-1H 13C HSQC spectra. The presence of a multiplet around 7.1 ppm and at 125–150 ppm in the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra, respectively, confirmed the presence of the p-cymene moiety. The pyrazol rings exhibit one set of resonance for the protons and carbons H4, Me3 and Me5, indicating that the pyrazole rings are equivalent ( Figure 3 ). The results are consistent with a square plane geometry for the platinum centre, with the ligand coordinated in a κ 2-NN bidentate fashion. 195NMR spectrum of 2P-Pt revealed one signal around -2300 ppm which correspond to the region expected for the coordination of two chlorine and two nitrogen atoms to the metal. The IR spectra of 2P-Pt exhibited C–N stretching bands in the range of 1000 cm−1 attributed to the pyrazol rings and it was identified new bands at around 1461–1394 cm−1 due to the C=C aromatic stretching vibrations of the p-cymene moiety (Michelin et al., 2011). The 3000 cm−1 region showed absorptions attributed to C\\H stretching of CH2 and CH3. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of 2P-Pt was recorded in a DMSO solution (10-5 M) at 25°C. The absorption maximum of the 2P ligand moves hyperchromically to 212 nm after metalation. This strong band may refer to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions between π-orbitals on Cl to d-orbitals of platinum. The stability of the new compound was tested in CDCl3 by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the compound were unchanged after three days in solution at room temperature. As it happens to many metallodrugs, the platinum compounds needed to be dissolved in a mixture of H2O:DMSO to perform biological assays which in any case did not exceed 0.25% v/v of DMSO. Therefore, the stability of the 2P-Pt in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6:D2O was carried out by NMR monitoring. The set of signals belonging to the starting complex persist throughout the stability experiments carried out in both experiments. The existence of only one pattern for 2P-Pt suggests ruling out fast chloride dissociation.

The elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed using the Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and were within ±0.4% of the theoretical values. The 500 MHz 1H and 126 MHz 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Plus 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer (Varian Inc., Paulo Alto, CA, USA). All spectra were recorded at room temperature, except where indicated otherwise, and were referenced internally to solvent reference frequencies. Chemical shifts (δ) are quoted in ppm and coupling constants (J) are reported in Hz. LC-MS spectra were obtained on a Finnigan MAT INCOS-50 (Thermo Finnigan LLC, San Jose, CA, USA). The reaction mixture was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using commercial glass-backed TLC plates (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254, Darmstadt, Germany).

Secondly, o-vanillin (0.3043 g, 2 mmol) was added into the above solution, and the mixture was refluxed for 8 h at 80 °C with continuous stirring, which then stewed for 24 h. The resulting reaction suspension was filtrated and washed by EtOH to obtain 0.4217 g (78.3%) of orange product (o-vanillin-p-aminoacetophenone Schiff base, m.p.: 118.2~119.1 °C).

Briefly, seeds of E. lathyris (2 kg) were refluxed with 95% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. After filtration, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to make a residue (230.4 g), which was suspended in distilled water and successively partitioned with petroleum ether, dichloromethane (DCM), and ethyl acetate. The DCM extract was separated and repeatedly purified by silica gel and HPLC column chromatography to afford EFL3 (400 mg).

The molecular formula of 3 was determined as C27H38O5 by HR-MS analysis (Figure S7), which gave an ion peak at m/z 443.2789 (calcd. for [M + H]−: 443.2792). Different from compound 1 (Figure S8), compound 3 showed C=O and O-H stretching vibration at 1725 cm−1 and 3432 cm−1, respectively, indicating a carboxyl group in this molecular. We compared the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 (Table 1, Figures S9 and S10) with those of compound 1, which showed that the NMR data of compounds 1 and 3 were highly similar. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 displayed three characteristic methyl signals at δ 0.82 (H3-18), 1.20 (H3-19), and 0.97 (H3-21), similar to the signals in compound 1, but the methyl signal of H3-27 disappeared. A comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum of 3 with the data of 1 showed the presence of a carboxyl group at δ 176.5 (C-27). The 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy, the heteronuclear multi-bond correlation spectroscopy (HMBC), and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) correlations (Figure 2, Figures S11–S13) indicated that the carboxyl group was linked to C-25. The NOESY spectrum (Figure S14) shows that H-25 is an axial bond, so the carboxyl group in compound 3 adopts an equatorial configuration. The structure of 3 was determined to be 25(R)-spirosta-4-dien-3-one-27-oic acid and was named diosgenone-27-oic acid. After surveying the public databases, compound 3 was determined as a new compound, which is the carboxylated metabolite of diosgenone at the C27 position. [/INST],\n",

As can be seen in Figure 2, spatial proximities were observed for H-1, H-2 and H-10b in the NOESY spectrum, indicating that these three hydrogens are on the same side of the plane. H-1 and H-2 appeared as two broad singlets with no noticeable splitting, suggesting a cis-orientation. In addition, H-10b and H-4a shared a J-coupling of 11.1 Hz, typical for the trans-orientation between these two hydrogens reported for the lycorine-type scaffold as mentioned above [27]. Therefore, combining NOE correlations and J-coupling information, it can be deduced that H-1, H-2 and H-10b were on the same side and were on the opposite side of H-4a. Among the three remaining possibilities as discussed above, the SRSS is the sole configuration that can show all these NOESY correlations. Hence, the relative configuration of compounds 2 and 3 was established as (1S,2R,4aS,10bS)-pseudolycorine, or its enantiomer. The structures of compounds 2 and 3 were elucidated with the configuration of one chiral center (at position H-2) differing from the configuration reported for pseudolycorine, and thus, correspond to 2-epi-pseudolycorine. To be noticed, C-4 was not observed in CD3OD, whereas it could be observed in (CD3)2SO in both HMBC and 13C-NMR spectra. Table 4 shows NMR data of compounds 2 and 3 in CD3OD and (CD3)2SO.  As reported in Table 3, the experimental optical rotation of 2-epi-pseudolycorine (compounds 2 and 3) was only −8.0 and was significantly different from the computed values, ranging from 227.9 to 230.6, if dextrorotatory, and from −230.4 to −227.7, if levorotatory. Based on these data, it was not possible to deduce the absolute configuration of compounds 2 and 3. At this point, it was hypothesized that the sample consisted of a racemic mixture. The fact that the measured value is not 0, but −8, could be caused by the presence of some impurities and/or the measurement or weighing errors due to the small amount of material. In order to determine whether the sample consisted of a racemate, an enantioseparation was performed, and the obtained HPLC chromatogram of the mixture of compounds 2 and 3 indeed showed two peaks with almost equal peak areas (Figure S20). Hence, the mixture of compounds 2 and 3 was confirmed to be a racemate. Compounds 2 and 3, occurring as an enantiomeric mixture, were reported for the first time and the name 2-epi-pseudolycorine was adopted. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrum of compounds 2 and 3 in (CD3)2SO was devoid of any signal, confirming the existence of a racemic mixture (Figure S23). Finally, the assignment of (−)-2-epi-pseudolycorine (2) to the configuration (1S, 2R, 4aS, 10bS) and (+)-2-epi-pseudolycorine (3) to the configuration (1R, 2S, 4aR, 10bR) was made according to their simulated optical rotations (see Table 3).

The 13C{1H} spectrum of compound 4 gave two signals at 36.98 and 160.2 ppm for the CH3 and CN3 carbons, respectively, with the downfield signal being weak. The presence of boron in these compounds was confirmed by 11B NMR (in D2O) for all compounds. All 11B spectra all showed three “signature” signals [31,33], arising through the decomposition of a pentaborate, with relative intensities appropriate for a sample that had attained polyborate/aqueous equilibrium [27]. Thus, compound 4 gave three signals at 1.0, 12.8, and 19.1 ppm with approximate relative intensities of 5%, 10%, and 85%, respectively. These signals have been previously assigned, moving downfield, to [B5O6(OH)4]− (tetrahedral B), [B3O4(OH)4]−, and B(OH)3/[B(OH)4]− [27]. Three signals were observed as the sample was relatively concentrated rather than one signal at +16.1, which would have been expected at infinite dilution [33]. [/INST],\n",

Absorption was observed at 3395.57 cm−1, 1366.88 cm−1, and 1132.58 cm−1, which corresponded to the OH stretching vibration, the in-plane deformation vibration of the tertiary alcohol δ(OH), and the stretching vibration of the tertiary alcohol ν(C–O), respectively (Figure S3). At 3395.57 cm−1, the peak shape was broad due to the hydrogen bond association between the terpineol molecules.  2.4. Direct Catalytic Hydration of α-Pinene without a Solvent [/INST],\n",

The reaction was carried out in a closed vial at 80 °C under efficient magnetic stirring and was carefully monitored by TLC. After 2 h, the absence of the starting reagent 7a was confirmed. The reaction was cooled down to room temperature. Then, distilled water and ethanol were added to the solution until a white solid precipitated. The resulting suspension was cooled down in an ice bath, and the solid was filtered off and washed successively with water, cold ethanol, and diethyl ether.

The deprotection of Cbz was accomplished using 1,4-cyclohexadiene following the procedure described by Schacht [44]. A solution of Cbz-Leu-Gly(5-FU) (420 mg, 933 mmol) in dry ethanol (40 mL) was added to a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. After purging the mixture with N2 for 30 min, 10% Pd/C (420 mg), freshly distilled 1,4-cyclohexadiene (806 mg, 6.05 mmol), and acetic acid (0.11 mL) were added. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC using DCM/MeOH 95:5 as an eluent. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the residue in the filter was rinsed with methanol (2 × 50 mL) containing 0.01% acetic acid. The filtrate solvent was removed by rotary evaporator under vacuum. The conversion was about 79% as calculated by 1H NMR. The diastereomers were purified directly by preparative reverse phase HPLC (Column: C18 Waters XBridge 2 µm OBD 19 × 250 mm) using a gradient of 5 to 15% acetonitrile (with 0.1% TFA) over 20 min. Both fractions eluting from 6.104 to 7.011 min and from 8.147 to 9.210 min were collected. The first fraction was assigned as 9a (L,L), while the second fraction was assigned as 9a (L,D). To remove TFA counterions from the isolated dipeptide, 50 mg of either 9a or 9b was dissolved in 50 mL of 5 mM HCl and subsequently lyophilized. The process was repeated twice to ensure the complete elimination of TFA.  9a (L,L):  [α]25D = +81.0° (c = 1, H2O) (Lit [α]25D = +94.0° (c = 1, H2O)) [41]  1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO) δ 12.07 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 9.82 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 8.19 (s, 3H), 8.15 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, 1H), 6.22 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 3.95 (br, 1H), 1.73–1.62 (m, 1H), 1.59 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 2H), 0.92 (dd, J = 10.7, 6.4 Hz, 6H).  19F NMR (377 MHz, DMSO) δ −169.81. 13C NMR (101 MHz, DMSO) δ 170.94, 167.21, 157.66, 149.25, 138.20, 140.49, 130.01, 64.21, 51.06, 24.04, 23.14, 22.27.

Cyclic trimers had a planar and rigid macrocyclic framework, where the cavity was surrounded by three carbonyl groups. In contrast, cyclic tetramers had a nonplanar and nonrigid macrocyclic framework. Cyclic trimer C3(Mes) associates with phenolic guest molecules, HQ and RE, in 1 : 1 ratio in solutions. Their association constants were ca. 1.0×103 L mol−1, as determined by the 1H NMR measurements. The DFT calculations revealed that the complexes were stabilized by two OH⋅⋅⋅O=C hydrogen bonds between the host and guest molecules. Because the guest molecules examined in this study are smaller than the cavity size, the cavity space (size‐fitting) as well as the noninteracting carbonyl group (multipoint recognition) is not fully utilized well for the molecular recognition. We are seeking for such guest molecules that can bind to the macrocyclic hosts tightly or selectively. We will be able to transform carbonyl moieties in acridone units into other groups to tune the size and the electronic demand of the cavity. Further studies of the synthesis of other acridone cyclic oligomers and their supramolecular properties by applying the polar and donor characters are in progress.  Experimental Section  The synthetic procedures of selected key macrocyclization steps and the physical and spectroscopic data of the final products are described here.

In a 100 mL round‐bottom flask, a mixture of 11 b (23.8 mg, 31.1 μmol), 13 (24.4 mg, 30.6 μmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (7.3 mg, 6.3 μmol), and CuI (1.1 mg, 5.8 μmol) in a degassed mixture of Et3N (15 mL) and THF (15 mL) was heated at 60 °C for 22 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was treated with water (100 mL) and the organic materials were extracted with CHCl3 (30 mL×3). The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica gel with CHCl3/EtOAc 1 : 1 eluent and recycle gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with CHCl3 eluent to give 4.9 mg (12%) of C3(H) as a yellow solid.

Then, a solution of 235 mg (1.05 mmol, 77 % pur.) of mCPBA in 2 mL of methanol was added dropwise at room temperature. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 2 minutes followed by concentration in vacuo. The residue was redissolved in methanol, deposited onto 4.0 g of silica, and the solvent was evaporated. The silica was then packed into a pre‐column and the desired thiourea S‐oxide was purified by means reversed‐phase medium pressure liquid chromatography on a PF‐15C18HQ‐F0012 column using aqueous methanol as a mobile phase. The product can be identified by an absorption feature around 300 nm in the UV/visible spectrum, where no substantial absorption is observed for any other compound in the mixture.

The reaction of 2 with quinoline gave an inseparable mixture of products, however, treatment of 1 with quinoline resulted in an immediate color change from red to blue, similar to the above reaction of 2 with pyridine. 11B NMR spectroscopic resonances at 25 and 30 ppm were observed after a few minutes, suggesting the presence of diborene 6, analogous to 3. However, the resonance at 25 ppm had disappeared after 10 minutes, while the signal at ca. 30 ppm had broadened significantly. An additional color change to green occured within one hour, and a near‐complete decoloration took place overnight, the remaining light yellow solution suggesting the absence of diborene in the mixture. After workup by washing the dried reaction mixture with hexane and crystallization from a saturated hexane solution, the product was identified by SCXRD as the borylalkylideneborane 7 (Scheme 2), a constitutional isomer of the presumed intermediate 6 in which one of the carbene carbon atoms has exchanged with one boron atom. The unexpected and highly unusual structure of 7 is confirmed by its NMR spectra. A singlet resonance corresponding to the alkylideneborane C−H proton was found in the 1H NMR spectrum at 3.79 ppm, presenting a cross‐signal to a 13C NMR resonance at 104.3 ppm in the 13C,1H HSQC NMR spectrum. This resonance is downfield of typical alkene resonances, but is in the same range as that of a cyclic borylalkylideneborane reported by Berndt et al. (115.2 ppm). [39] The broad resonance observed in the 11B NMR spectrum of 7 (30 ppm) can be rationalized by the superposition of two signals. [/INST],\n",

Although the rate of a further reaction between 6 and two molar equivalents of the less bulky, but similarly charged, N‐donor nucleophile NaNPh2 was also limited by the low solubility of the amide reagent, heating to 40 °C over the course of 3 days was sufficient to induce the formation of sodium metal as a grey powder and a colorless solution, which was observed to comprise a single predominant product (10) by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Compound 10 was isolated by removal of volatiles, washing with hexane and crystallization from hot benzene, which provided colorless single crystals suitable for X‐ray diffraction analysis (Figure 5).

As expected, the main difference compared with the spectrum of unlabelled material was the signal assigned to 12‐H which showed characteristic 1H‐13C coupling: δ 5.85 (1H, app. ddt, J 149.5, 10.0, 3.0). The enhanced signal at δ 136.7 assigned to C‐12 in the 13C NMR spectrum of (12‐13C)21 was accompanied by a minor slightly downfield signal in a ratio of approximately 5 : 1, as observed in previous syntheses. [7] Following demethylation, the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of (12‐13C)3 were broad due to tautomerism of the free tetronic acid. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed a 3 : 1 mixture of major to minor isomers, clearly visible in the enhanced C‐12 signals shown in Figure 2A. LC–MS analysis showed the presence of a single peak with the expected mass, and the two species were chromatographically inseparable. The presence of two enriched signals in the 13C NMR spectrum was attributed to the presence of atropisomers, as reported for the natural product, and this material was used in in vitro AbyV assays.

The presence of monosaccharides in 1 was further confirmed by acid hydrolysis and GC analyses. The results of the GC-MS analysis showed D-glucose (D-Glc), L-rhamnose (L-Rha), and D-fructose (D-Fru) in a ratio of 1:1:1 by comparing the retention times with the corresponding authentic samples. In the 1H-NMR spectrum, two anomeric protons were observed at δH 4.49 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1 of Glc) and δH 5.20 (br s, H-1 of Rha), and the corresponding carbon signals were obtained at δC 100.9 (C-1 of Glc) and δC 102.2 (C-1 of Rha) by analyzing the HSQC correlations, respectively. In the 13C-NMR spectrum, there was a specific quaternary carbon at δC 105.2, which was identified as the anomeric carbon of D-Fru. Then, the assignments of protons and carbons in each monosaccharide were determined by analyzing the 1H-1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC and TOCSY spectra (Table 2). The β configuration of D-glucopyranosyl was revealed by the anomeric proton coupling constants (J = 7.8 > 7.0 Hz) and the α configuration of L-rhamnopyranosyl was confirmed by the chemical shifts of C-5 of Rha (δC 69.8) [14,15]. The β configuration of D-fructofuranosyl was confirmed by the chemical shifts of δC 62.1 (C-1 of Fru), 105.2 (C-2 of Fru), 79.2 (C-3 of Fru), 76.6 (C-4 of Fru), 83.7 (C-5 of Fru) and 64.2 (C-6 of Fru) [16]. The linkage sequences of monosaccharides were determined by the correlations in the HMBC spectrum, which were observed from δH 3.66 (H-1 of Fru) to δC 61.6 (C-6 of Glc), δH 5.20 (H-1 of Rha) to δC 78.9 (C-2 of Glc), and δH 4.49 (H-1 of Glc) to δC 79.6 (C-3 of the aglycone) (Figure 2). The α orientation of H-3 was deduced from the correlations of H3-19 (δH 1.05) to Hβ-1 (δH 1.10), and Hα-1 (δH 1.88) to H-3 (δH 3.58) in the NOESY spectrum [15]. The 25R configuration was deduced from the difference in the geminal protons of H-26 (∆δH = 0.12 < 0.48) [17]. Thus, the structure of compound 1 was elucidated as diosgenin-3-O-β-D-fructofuranosyl-(1→6)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside. [/INST],\n",

TBDMS-protected 1,4-triazole 18 (70 mg, 0.086 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (1.0 mL) and the resulting mixture was cooled to −78 °C. To the cryogenic mixture, a solution of 1M TBAF in THF (100 µL) was added. After 5 min, the cooling bath was removed, and, then, the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 75 min at room temperature, HPLC analysis showed the complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction mixture was concentrated into a crude oil residue which was dissolved in ethyl acetate (2.0 mL) and washed with DI H2O (2.0 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×, 2.0 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with DI H2O (2.0 mL), dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to produce a crude desired product (61 mg), which was taken forward without any further purification. HPLC purity: 95.7% AUC (retention time: 10.8 min). THP-protected 1,4-triazole from the desilylation step (61 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (0.5 mL)/methanol (0.1 mL) and allowed to stir under nitrogen atmosphere until complete dissolution was achieved. To the solution, 4 N HCl in 1,4-dioxane (100 µL) was added, and the reaction was allowed to stir for 2.5 h at room temperature where HPLC analysis revealed that the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude oil. The crude oil was dissolved in dichloromethane (300 µL), and diethyl ether (2.0 mL) was slowly added to generate a white slurry. The slurry was allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 20 min. The slurry was filtered, and the filter cake was washed with diethyl ether (1.5 mL) followed by hexane (3.0 mL); then, the solids were further dried in vacuo at room temperature to provide the desired 1,4-triazole carboranyl hydroxamic acid hydrochloride salt 4 (45 mg, 80%) as a white solid.

The obtained suspension was slowly warmed up to room temperature and then left for an additional 20 min with stirring. Next, the reaction mixture was evaporated under vacuum, and the subsequently obtained crude, sticky, yellowish oil was prepurified with column chromatography using CHCl3/MeOH (20:1) as the eluent. The final products were purified with semipreparative HPLC (Shimadzu, LC 20AD, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a ultraviolet (UV) detector (SPD M20A), which was set at 283 nm. For the separation, the Synergy Polar-RP C18 column (Phenomenex, Gemini, Warsaw, Poland; 150 mm × 10 mm, 5 μL in particle size and 110 Å in pore size) was used, at 25 °C with a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The linear gradient of 0–80% phase B in 10 min was used (mobile phase A: 0.1% HCOOH in water, B: 80% acetonitrile in water). Products were obtained as colorless, sticky oils. Tetra-Et-dCDP was obtained with 25% yield (m = 1.118 g, n = 0.00224 mol) and di-Et-dCMP with 44% yield (m = 1.401 g, n = 0.00386 mol). 2′-Deoxycytidine 1, diethyl phosphorochloridate 2, and anhydrous pyridine were purchased from Merck.

The most active fraction was further purified by Sephadex LH-20, reverse-phase C18 cartridges, and HPLC, and the inhibitory activity was determined by a cress bioassay. One active compound was isolated and characterized through HR-ESIMS, 1H, and 13C-NMR. The aglycone moiety of the active compound had a polyoxypregnan-20-one skeleton according to a comparison of its 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopic signals with those of marsdenosides A–H [43] and tenacissosides L and M [44], which was identified from the stem of M. tenacissima. Therefore, the structure of the active compound was elucidated based on the spectroscopic data of pregnane glycoside or C21 steroidal glycoside. The spectroscopic signals of the pregnane skeleton were assigned through analysis of 1H-1H COSY, TOCSY, HMBC, and NOESY spectra (Figure 6A,B). In the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra, we found that the two angular methyl groups at CH3-18 and CH3-19 (δH 0.94 (s), 1.04 (s); δC 12.6, 11.7) (Table 2); one tertiary methyl group at CH3-21 (δH 2.12 (s); δC 32); three oxygenated tertiary carbons at CH-3, CH-11, and CH-12 (δH 3.61, m 5.28, dd (10.1, 10.1), 4.86, d (10.1); δC 77.9, 72.5, 78.7); three quaternary carbons at C-10, C-13, and C14 (δC 38.7, 55.6, 85.2); two secondary methyl groups at CH3-6′″ (δH 1.35, d (5.9); δC 18.8) and CH3-12′″ (δH 1.23, d (6.3); δC 18.2); two methoxy groups at CH3-13′″ (δH 3.40 (s); δC 57.4) and CH3-14′″ (δH 3.59 (s); δC 62.5); and the ester carbonyl signals at C-1′ (δC 172.1) and C-1″ (δC 169.1) indicated that the active compound carried two acyl groups. An NMR study (1H and 13C-NMR, HMBC, TOCSY, and NOESY) and a consideration of the molecular structure of the active compound includes one carbonyl carbon of a ketone group, two acyl groups, five methyls, seven methylenes, six methines, three quaternary carbons (one oxygenated), two olefinic carbons, and dehydroxy alcohol, as well as two sugar units.

Indeed, upon the addition of one equivalent of methyl iodide to a THF solution of 2 at −80 °C, the yellow color immediately disappeared concomitantly with the precipitation of a white solid. After treatment, the desired C-methylated salt 3 was isolated in an 85% yield. The methylation was confirmed by the presence of two characteristic signals for the methyl group at δ = 1.67 ppm and δ = 10.2 ppm in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively (see Supplementary Materials). C-methylated salt 3 was isolated in crystalline form by layering diethyl ether onto a saturated dichloromethane solution, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 2). As expected, the S-C bond lengths in 3 (1.682 and 1.687 Å) are very similar to those of the protonated bis-ylide precursor 1 (1.685 Å and 1.676 Å) [30] and much shorter than an S-C single bond length (1.81 Å), showing the delocalization of the negative charge from the central carbon atom to the SPh2 fragments and justifying the planar environment around the C1 atom (∑°= 359.7°). The S1-C1-S2 angle is also almost identical to that of 1. [/INST],\n",

The SEC/RI trace of 2 is shown in Figure 2, with values of Mw (MALS) = 129.1 kDa, Ð = 1.18, and Rh (VIS) = 9.2 nm. We attributed the slight increase in Rh to steric effects along the copolymer chain induced by the replacement of the –Cl groups with –N3 moieties. The total replacement of –Cl moieties with –N3 functional groups was confirmed by both 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. [/INST],\n",

The comparison of 13C NMR data (Table 2) for C and D-rings is, therefore, in agreement with those reported in the literature for E1 [43]. A functionalized side chain linked at position C-3 of the steroid by an amide bond influences the chemical shifts of the A-ring signals, mainly in 13C NMR. Thus, deshielding effects are observed on the carbons in ortho (C-2/+13.3 ppm and C-4/+12.0 ppm) and para (C-10/+6.0 ppm), as well as a shielding effect on the carbon carrying the chain (C-3/−13.3 ppm) compared to the data of C-1 to C-5 and C-10 of E2 (Table 1). The presence of the o-trifluoromethylphenylsulfonamide-trans-dimethylpiperazinoamide chain is confirmed by the appearance of several characteristic but complex signals, except for the carbonyl (C-1′) of the amide at 171.5 ppm. Thus, due to the presence of amide and sulfonamide bonds, as well as possible conformations, the substituted piperazine ring gives rise to several signals between 40.5 and 50.0 ppm (CH2 and CH) and 15.8 and 14.4/14.6 ppm (CH3) in 13C NMR, as well as broad signals between 3.30 and 4.90 ppm (CH2, CH) and 1.06 and 1.19 ppm (CH3) in 1H NMR. The phenyl ring of the side chain gives rise to four aromatic CHs (7.70–8.18 ppm) in 1H NMR in addition to their corresponding CH and C signals (C-1‴ to CH-6‴) in 13C NMR. The presence of three fluorine atoms (CF3) causes the characteristic splitting of carbons carrying or neighboring the fluorine atom in the form of a quadruplet (q). Among other things, CF3, therefore, appears at 122.5 (q, 2JCF = 274 Hz), C-2‴ at 127.2 (q, 3JCF = 32 Hz), and C-3‴ at 128.6 (q, 4JCF = 6.4 Hz). [/INST],\n",

[α]26D: +54.2 (c 0.01, CHCl3). The molecular formula was determined as C15H22O5 (five degrees of unsaturation) via HR-ESI-MS (m/z 305.13598, ([M+Na]+, C21H30NaO5+; calcd. 305.13592)), which was in agreement with the 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1). The UV spectrum absorption λmax (MeOH) at 242 nm, and a strong IR absorption at 1675 cm−1, as well as the observation of the featuring carbon resonances [δC 132.1 (C-8a), 146.2 (C-4a), and 195.1 (C-8)] in the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 1), revealed the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality in 1. The remaining IR spectrum revealed the presence of the OH group (3410 cm−1), and ester (1715 cm−1), respectively.

Among all tested compounds, (+)-elatol (1) was the most active compound against trophozoites of Naegleria fowleri, strains ATCC 30808™ and ATCC 30215™, with IC50 values of 1.08 μM and 1.14 μM, respectively. The activity of (+)-elatol (1) against the resistant stage of N. fowleri was also assessed, showing great cysticidal properties with a very similar IC50 value (1.14 µM) to the one obtained for the trophozoite stage. Its enantiomer (−)-elatol (2) was also analyzed, showing to be 34-fold less potent with an IC50 of 36.77 μM and 38.03 μM, thus revealing that spatial disposition is crucial for the anti-Naegleria activity. Additionally, the structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis suggests that dehalogenation leads to a significant decrease of activity. The lipophilic character of these compounds, such as (+)-elatol (1) (log P 3.65), confers them as good chemical scaffolds to develop new drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier.  6.

As a result, C70-P-B and C70-Boc obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition are a mixture of isomers. From the 1H NMR spectrum, it can be concluded that C70-P-B contains at least three isomers. The peaks at ~8.25–8.19 ppm are assigned to the perylene skeleton protons; peaks at ~7.73–6.84 ppm are assigned to phenyl ring protons; peaks at ~6.01–5.32 ppm are assigned to pyrrolidine protons and pyrrole ring protons; peaks at ~4.48–3.52 ppm are assigned to OCH2CH3; peaks at ~2.64–2.06 ppm are assigned to protons of pyrrole ring CH3, and peaks at ~1.52–0.87 ppm are assigned to OCH2CH3, protons of the pyrrole ring CH3 and C(CH3)3 of perylene. The 13C NMR spectrum of C70-P-B also shows the expected signals. For example, the peaks from 169.53–163.01 ppm are assigned to the carbons of C=O, the peaks from 157.42–118.97 ppm are assigned to the sp2-C of C70 and the benzene ring, the peaks at ~74.23–72.86 ppm are carbons of CHCO2, the peaks from 70.88–70.38 ppm are assigned the sp3-C of C70, peaks from 65.40–60.33 ppm are assigned the carbons of OCH2CH3, peaks from 34.19–29.96 ppm are carbons of C(CH3)3 and C(CH3)3, and peaks from 14.62–13.93 ppm are carbons of CH3. The mass spectrum of C70-P-B gives a molecular peak at m/z 2482.7023, which is consistent with the calculated data.  2.2. UV-Vis Absorption and Steady-State Fluorescence [/INST],\n",

The deshielding effects on the other CH2 groups were also diagnostic: the newly triazole moieties in HP1 caused a downshift in the CH2 protons at 5.3 ppm (blue marker), 3.7 ppm (black marker), and 4.4 ppm (gray marker) compared to those of monomer 4, which were centered at 4.9 ppm (red marker), 4.2 (orange marker), and 3.5 ppm (green marker), respectively. The remaining broadened signals at 4.2 ppm and 3.6 ppm corresponded to the protons of the linear units in HP1. We attributed the small signals at 7.8 ppm and 5.6 ppm to the azide-containing terminal units of the hyperbranched structure, according to the literature [52]. In fact, only unreacted azido groups could be detected in the purified HP1. This evidence is in accordance with the FTIR spectra (see Supporting Information), in which the typical C-H stretching of triple bonds (ca. 3300 cm−1) was not observed, while the stretching band of the azido group at ca. 2100 cm−1 was detectable. Such an observation is supported when also considering the 13C-NMR spectra of HP1, in which a diagnostic signal at ca. 50 ppm, related to the CH2N3 carbon resonance, was present.

The molecular formula of C28H16O7 was deduced using HR-ESIMS (m/z 465.0967 [M + H]+, calcd. for 465.0974 and m/z 463.0717 [M − H]−, calcd. for 463.0818), indicating 21 degrees of unsaturation. The 1H, 13C NMR, HSQC, and HMBC spectra (Supplementary Materials Figures S8–S12) were similar to those of compound 1, which indicated that compound 1 was a homologue of compound 1. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 2 showed the presence of 10 aromatic proton signals, one signal more than compound 1. By comparing the 13C NMR spectrum with those of compound 1, the chemical shift of C-9 was shifted to high-field (δC 152.3 in 1, δC 130.6 in 2).

The synthesis procedure of the NDC compound was shown as follows: 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid (238 mg, 1 mmol), compound III (230 mg, 1 mmol), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDCI, 230 mg, 1.2 mmol)) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 12.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of CH2Cl2, and the reaction was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The synthesis procedure of NDC was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. Once the reaction was completed, the solution was extracted by CH2Cl2, then it was washed twice with saturated NaHCO3 solution, and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Following the removal of the solvent, the crude product was obtained and recrystallized in absolute ethanol to offer the NDC compound.

XAFS measurement demonstrated the atomically dispersed state of gram-scale Co SAC with no appreciable difference compared with Co1/NOC-21 (Supplementary Fig. 28). Under optimized reaction conditions, the gram-scale Co SAC was evaluated to be effective for SB epoxidation with a high yield of 92.6% (Fig. 4e). The obtained SB epoxidation product (SBO) was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Fig. 4f). In the 1H NMR spectrum, the triplet peak at 4.07 ppm corresponds to the hydrogen adjacent to the epoxy group, and the multiple peak with a chemical shift at 7.34−7.40 ppm corresponds to the aromatic hydrogen, indicating the high purity of SBO (>96%) compared with commercial production (Supplementary Fig. 29). The peak splitting and peak area coupled with 13C NMR were all consistent with the SBO (Supplementary Fig. 30). Overall, the densely populated Co SAC displayed superior catalytic performance, showing the potential for industrial application in stilbene epoxidation.

The remaining black precipitate of [Ru(phen)2Cl2] was removed by filtration and 10 drops of a saturated aqueous solution of NH4PF6 were added to the filtrate under stirring. The resulting red precipitate was isolated by filtration and washed with EtOH (2 × 10 mL) and Et2O (2 × 10 mL). The crude was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using as an eluent a 9:1 mixture of acetonitrile and aqueous KNO3 (0.1 M). The fraction corresponding to complex 1 was evaporated and the solid obtained was redissolved in acetonitrile; the white solid corresponding to KNO3 was filtered off, washed with diethyl ether and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, giving pure 1 as a red solid with a yield of 43% (0.076 g, 0.12 mmol). Compound 1 was stored at room temperature, protected from light. The TLC of pure 1 (eluent: CH3CN 9/0.1 M KNO3 1) is shown in Fig. S6. Single crystals of 1, suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, were obtained by slow diffusion of diethyl ether into a saturated solution of the ruthenium complex in acetonitrile; an X-ray structure of 1 was reported in 2008 [49].

Glacial AcOH (6 μL, 105 μmol, 4.10 equiv) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 15 min. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was loaded onto a short silica gel column using EtOAc and eluted with the same solvent in order to remove as much as possible of the tetrabutylammonium salts (which elutes just after the desired product). The fractions containing product were placed in a −20 °C freezer and allowed to stand until a precipitate formed. The supernatant was quickly removed with a Pasteur pipet, and the solid material was swiftly washed with a small amount of EtOAc (which had been precooled in the same freezer). The material thus obtained was purified again by flash column chromatography (SiO2, 50% EtOAc in heptane → EtOAc) through a short column in order to remove the last remaining traces of TBAF salts, yielding dothideopyrone E (1, 5.0 mg, 15.9 μmol, 62%) as a clear oil.

Compound D was then synthesized from Compound A using the outlined process by first adding 5-chlorosalicyclaldehyde (A, 1.55 g, 10 mM) to CH3CN (5 mL) in a 35 mL reaction tube. Dimethylmalonate (B) (1.45 g, 11 mM) and ethyl piperdine-3-carboxylate (C) (15 mg, 10 mol%) in 15 mL of CH3CN were added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. After the evaporation of CH3CN, the crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography to give a white solid D (1.6 g, 60%). Basic hydrolysis of compound D was performed to produce Compound E acid (6-chloro-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxylic acid). Acid synthesis was initiated by adding methyl 6-chloro-2-oxo-2H-chromene3-carboxylate D (1.0 g, 4.2 mM) in ethanol to sodium hydroxide (10% w/v in 20 mL ethanol). The mixture was stirred under reflux for 24 h. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with 10% HCl. The solid precipitated out and was isolated and washed with water, yielding compound E (white solid, 80% yield). Using compound E, we further derivatized to amide (BT173) using a simple amide coupling reaction in the presence of coupling reagents. The 6-chloro-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxylic acid E (1.0 mM) was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (3 mL) in a 35 mL reaction tube. Then 4-hydroxy aniline (1.1 mM) and DCC (1.2 mM) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction was then quenched with a saturated aqueous NaOH solution and extracted with DCM (10 × 3 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and then filtered. After evaporation of the organic solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain BT317, 6-Chloro-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide (Fig. 1B; white solid, 78% yield). The reagents used for the synthesis were purchased from Fisher Scientific. The structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and proton, carbon, and mass spectrometry, and the purity of the compound was determined by HPLC. The lead compound, BT317, was evaluated using NMR as follows: 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 10.44 (s, 1H), 9.43 (s, 1H), 8.87 (s, 1H), 8.16 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, 1H), 7.82 (dd, J = 8.8, 2.6 Hz, 1H), 7.61 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 6.78 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, DMSO) δ 160.0, 158.8, 154.2, 152.4, 145.7, 134.2, 133.5, 129.5, 129.0, 121.6, 121.2, 119.9, 118.2, 115.3.

The 1H NMR data contained two methyl singlets at δH 1.31 (3H, s, H-19), 0.86 (3H, overlap, H-20), one methyl doublet at δH 0.85 (3H, d, J = 6.8 Hz, H-17), two olefinic protons at δH 5.48 and δH 5.80 (H-12), and an oxymethine signal at δH 5.97 (1H, s) (Figure S3). The 13C NMR experiment indicated the presence of twenty carbon atoms, including three methyl groups at δC 14.7, 24.1, 22.1, two strongly deshielded sp2 carbons at δC 171.4,172.0, two alkenyl carbons at δC 118.4, 116.9, a hemiacetal carbon at δC 99.4, and a carboxyl carbon at δC 182.6 (Figure S4). On the basis of HMQC and HMBC spectra, the existence of a γ-hydroxyl butenolide group was assumed from the presence of signals assignable to the hemiacetal carbon at δC 99.4 (C-16), two sp2 carbons at δC 171.4 (C-13), 116.9 (C-14), and a carbonyl carbon at δC 172.0 (C-15) (Figures S5, S6). And the connection between the hexahydroindene skeleton and hydroxyl butenolide group was assisted by a two-atom aliphatic chain whose signals appeared as correlation peaks between H-11 and H-12 in 1H-1H COSY experiment and of H-20 with C-11 in HMBC spectrum. The relative configuration of Vitenegu acid was determined from ROESY (Figures S7-11). The ROESY correlations of H-10 with H-12/Me-17 deduced that H-10, H-11, H-12, and Me-17 were α-oriented. H-8 was assigned as β-oriented according to the correlation of H-20.  Figure 1 Screening NLPR3 inflammasome natural inhibitors from V. negundo L. (A) Chemical structure of Vitenegu acid.

For the synthesis of tetra­kis­(4,5-di­hydro­furan-2-yl)silane (1), tert-butyl­lithium (31.0 ml, 1.90 M in pentane, 58.90 mmol, 4.00 eq.) was added at 228 K to a solution of 2,3-di­hydro­furan (4.14 g, 59.10 mmol, 4.00 eq.) in diethyl ether (approx. 100 ml). The reaction solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Then, tetra­chloro­silane (2.50 g, 14.70 mmol, 1.00 eq.) was added at 243 K and the reaction solution was stirred for 1 h. The resulting solid was separated by inert filtration. The obtained solution was concentrated in vacuo and crystallized at 243 K. The solvent was removed and the solid was washed with cold diethyl ether. The product tetra­kis­(4,5-di­hydro­furan-2-yl)silane (1) (3.05 g, 10.0 mmol, 68%) was obtained as colourless blocks. 1H NMR: (600.29 MHz, C6D6): δ = 2.25 [dt, 3 J HH = 2.57 Hz, 3 J HH = 9.72 Hz, 8H; Si(CCHCH 2)4], 4.06 [t, 3 J HH = 9.72 Hz, 8H; Si(COCH 2)4], 5.88 [t, 3 J HH = 2.57 Hz, 4H; Si(CCH)4] ppm. {1H}13C NMR: (150.94 MHz, C6D6): δ = 31.4 [4C; Si(CCHCH2)4], 71.0 [4C; Si(COCH2)4], 117.8 [4C; Si(CCH)4], 155.1 [4C; (Si(CO)4] ppm. {1H}29Si NMR: (119.26 MHz, C6D6): δ = −51.40 [s, 1Si; Si(DHF)4] ppm.

Afterward, the resulting PBSR1 was continuedly reacted with TFA (4 mL, 2 mol/L) at 110 °C for 3 h followed by reduction with NaBH4 to produce the acetylated product. The analysis was performed by an Agilent 7890A/5975C instrument with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 mm) (Thermo Co., Austin, TX, USA). The temperature program was heated up from 150 to 250 °C at 6 °C/min, then kept at 250 °C for 15 min. The PMAAs of the samples were analyzed by m/z and expressed as a relative percentage of each component.  2.3.5. 2D NMR Measurement A total of 60 mg of PBSR1 was replaced with D2O three times and then finally dissolved in 0.5 mL D2O for the NMR experiment. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy (HMBC) were recorded by using a 5 mm CYBBFO at an ultra-low temperature and a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Group, Fällanden, Switzerland) at 333.15 K [21].  2.4.

Two major anomeric proton signals were displayed at δ 4.46 and δ 4.71 ppm in 1H NMR (Figure 6A), suggesting both two residues contained β-configuration glycosidic bonds due to the chemical shifts below δ 5.0 ppm [27]. Residues A and B were annotated accordingly for the facilitation of the pattern determination, which was confirmed by two significant intercorrelated signals in the anomeric region of the HSQC spectrum (Figure 6D). Other proton signals (H2–H6) were found in the region of δ 3.51–4.35. 13C NMR provided the corresponding anomeric carbon resonances at δ 103.31 and δ 103.78 ppm (Figure 6B). All the chemical shifts of the proton for each residue could be assigned by the COSY spectrum in Figure 6C. Followingly, their corresponding carbon resonances were dug out in 13C NMR and HSQC spectra. Those chemical shifts are summarized in detail in Table 2. [/INST],\n",

In a three-neck flask, 0.715 g of 2-cyanophenol, 0.963 g of NH4Cl, 25 mL of DMF, and 1.17 g of NaN3 were sequentially added and heated to 130 °C for 10 h. The resulting solution was quenched in 100 mL of water, acidified to pH 1 with 6 mol/L HCl, and recrystallized in water to obtain 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole. In another three-neck flask, 1 g of 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole was dissolved in 16 mL of a 3 mol/L NaOH solution, and the resultant solution was slowly added dropwise to 0 °C with stirring. Then, 0.674 g of ice-cold acetic anhydride was added and stirred for 10 min and filtered and purified by column chromatography to obtain white solid 5-(2-acetoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole. Subsequently, 1.84 g of 5-(2-acetoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole, 4.98 g of anhydrous K2CO3, 0.55 g of cyanuric chloride, and 80 mL of methanol were sequentially added to a three-neck flask, and the mixture was heated at 90 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was filtered, and the filtrate was collected and rotary evaporated. The resulting powder was dissolved in methanol, and the pH of the reaction system was adjusted to 8–10 by adding the NaOH solution. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 4 h. After the reaction was complete, the pH was adjusted to weakly acidic with diluted HCl to precipitate the white solid. The solid was filtered and purified by column chromatography to obtain tri-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-[1,2,4]-triazolo-[1,3,5]-triazine (TTTL). Tdec: 125.8 °C.

Melanin is generally dissolved in a deuterated solvent such as deuterium oxide/sodium deuteroxide (D2O/NaOD) [110,111] or dimethylsulfoxide-D6 (DMSO-D6) [112,113]. There are several chemical shifts in the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra of melanin that can support the correct identification of melanin molecular structures [44]. As an example, characteristic 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained for the intracellular melanin extracted from Lachnum singerianum YM296 mycelium [114]. In the 1H-NMR spectra, the chemical shifts between 6 and 8 ppm were attributed to the aromatic hydrogens of indole and/or pyrrole rings. The observed peaks between 3.2 and 4.2 ppm were caused by the methyl or methylene groups attached to nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms. The presence of an NH-group linked to indole was attributed to the signals within the range of 1.3–2.5 ppm. In the 13C-NMR spectra, the peaks between 160 and 185 ppm were typically ascribed to the carbon atoms in carboxyl groups or the carbonyl groups of peptidic bonds [111]. The peaks between 120 and 140 ppm could be generated by aromatic carbons, probably involved in indole or pyrrole systems. The resonance peaks of carbon atoms linked to a nitrogen or sulfur were visible within 50–60 ppm, while the peaks of carbon atoms from methyl and methylene groups were detected within 10–40 ppm [114]. The 1H and 13C-NMR resonance peaks observed for several melanins have been reported [44,49,111]. [/INST],\n",

Moreover, at room temperature, the 13C NMR exhibited six signals in the aromatic part of the spectrum (quaternary + CH aromatic carbons), which is only half the expected number. In order to shed some light on this matter, we studied the dynamic behavior of compound 4 using the variable temperature (VT) NMR technique. As can be seen in Figure 5, the 13C NMR spectrum in C2D2Cl4 at 298 K shows three signals for quaternary aromatic carbons and three poorly resolved signals for CH aromatic carbons. As the temperature increased, new peaks gradually appeared. At the highest temperature (403 K), all 12 expected signals in the aromatic region were finally visible (Figure 5, the uppermost spectrum). Fascinatingly, lowering the temperature to 213 K eventually led to the same 12 signals being observed in the aromatic part (three small peaks at 128.5, 144.5, and 155.0 belonging to the starting thiacalixarene 1, which was formed in the reaction as a difficult-to-separate impurity).

In the GC–MS analysis, the chromatogram showed a majority signal at 8.49 min, and in its mass spectrum, a molecular ion of 284 [M+] (Figure S1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed a characteristic singlet of a phenolic OH group [δH 12.3 (s, OH)], two signals from aromatic protons [δH 6.77 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1H), 6.37 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1H)], a characteristic signal of methoxy hydrogens [δH 3.86 (s, 3H)] corresponding to ring A. Aromatic proton signals δH 8.19 (d, J = 7 Hz, 2H) and 7.61–7.47 (m, 3H) correspond to ring B (Figure S2). The 13C NMR spectrum presented 14 carbon signals (Table 1) attributable to a signal corresponding to a C-4 carbonyl group [δC 176.4], 7 quaternary aromatic C atoms, which include at least 5 oxygenated-C signals at δC 165.1, 160.4, 156.3, 146.1, and 137.4. The signals at δC 127.5 and 128.5 are equivalent to the carbons at the C-2′, C-6′, C-3′, and C-7′ positions, respectively, of ring B.

HRESIMS showed a quasi-molecular ion peak at 291.1564 (M+Na)+ calculated for C15H24O4 (291.1572) with four degrees of unsaturation. As per Table 1, 1HNMR revealed the presence of three methyls at ⸹H 1.00 (S), 1.23(d, J = 6.9 Hz), and 1.36 (S), assigned to methyls 14, 13, and 15, respectively.

The above data, together with 13CNMR, confirmed the structure of (2) to be vulgarin metabolite with the replacement of carbonyl at C1 by oxygenated methine group and the saturation of the olefenic double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Moreover, an APT experiment showed a total of 15 carbon atoms distinguished into three methyles, 4 methylene, 5 methins, and three quaternaries. The three quaternaries resonated at 41.6, 71.5, and 178.7, assigned to C10, C4 and C12, respectively.

As per Table 1, 1HNMR showed, in addition to oxygenated methine at 3.49 ppm, an olfenic double bond at ⸹H 5.94 (dd, J = 10.1,5.6) and 5.70 (d, J = 10.1 Hz) assigned to a proton at C2 and 3. The proton at C2 was coupled to that one at C1 and C3 in 1H-1HCOSY experiment, which give an idea about the replacement of carbonyl at C1 in vulgarin by a secondary alcoholic group. Additionally, 1HNMR showed three methyls, two of them are singlets resonating at ⸹H 0.97 and 1.39, and the third one is doublet, and it appeared at ⸹H 1.25 (d, J = 6.9 Hz), assigned to methyls 14, 15, and 13, respectively. A lactonic proton appeared at ⸹H 4.05 and was split as dd (J = 10.7 and 11.4 Hz) and assigned to proton at C6 and connected to its direct attached carbon at ⸹c 81.5 in 2D HSQC experiments.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to determine the chemical structures of compound 1c and identified 1b, which was reported by Bashyal et al. 2019 [27]. The 1H NMR spectra of 1b and 1c both showed the presence of a proton anomeric signal at signal δ 3.32–3.22 (m) and δ 4.91 (d). The signal at 1.99 ppm (s) confirmed the attachment of one acetyl group of a glucose molecule to the aglycone with a β-configuration, which is different from the 1H NMR spectrum of 1b (Figures S1A and S2A). In the 13C NMR spectrum, the signals at δ 21.12 ppm and δ 170.70 ppm were assigned to the carbons of one acetyl group, which was different from the 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1b (Figures S1B and S2B). Eighteen carbons were obtained from the 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1c, confirming the molecular formula of C18H24O7. Furthermore, to confirm the correlation of aglycon protons and glucose moiety protons, two-dimensional (2D)-NMR analysis and 1H–1H COSY was performed. According to 1H, 13C NMR, and COSY NMR spectra results, 1c was confirmed as isoeugenol-1-O-β-d-(2″-acetyl)-glucoside (Table 1, Figures S1 and S2).  2.3.

In the 1H-NMR data (Table 1 and Figure S12), signals from the low-field region suggested the presence of penta- [δH 6.90 (1H, s)] and monosubstituted [δH 7.50 (2H, d, J = 7.3 Hz), 7.38 (2H, t, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.29 (1H, s)] benzene rings. The peaks of δH 7.08 (1H, d, J = 16.3 Hz) and δH 7.29 (1H, d, J = 15.1 Hz), with their large coupling constants, suggested that they belonged to two trans-protons on a double bond. The above information led to the elucidation that compound 2 is also a stilbene derivative. In addition, resonances at δH 3.88 (3H, s) and δC 56.1 signified a methoxy group. The signal of δC 169.4 implied the presence of a carbonyl. Resonances of δH 2.41 (1H, dd, J = 17.4, 7.6 Hz), 2.79 (1H, dd, J = 17.4, 5.5 Hz), 3.65-3.62 (1H, m), 1.25 (3H, s), and 1.14 (3H, s) on the 1H-NMR, with their corresponding signals at δC 26.8, 67.9, 77.7, 25.9, and 20.6 on the 13C-NMR (Table 1), suggested the presence of a hydroxylated isopentyl moiety, which was cyclized into a six-membered ring with its ortho hydroxy group. The NMR data of 2 were found to resemble those of Chiricaine B [13], except that for 2, a hydroxy group changed into a methoxy group, and there was an additional signal of a carbonyl. The location of the methoxy group was determined by the following HMBC correlations: δH 3.88/δC 157.9; δH 2.41 (1H, dd, J = 17.4, 7.6 Hz), 2.79 (1H, dd, J = 17.4, 5.5 Hz)/δC 157.9. The location of the carbonyl was settled by the HMBC correlation of δH 6.90 (1H, s) with δC 109.4 (key HMBC correlations are shown in Figure 2). The experimental ECD spectrum of compound 2 agreed with its calculated data of 2”R configuration (Figure 3b), so the absolute configuration of compound 2 (structure shown in Figure 1) was elucidated as 2”R. Thus, compound 2 was determined to be new, and given the name cajanstilbenoid D. [/INST],\n",

A total of 63 DMU-212 metabolites were determined and summarized through quick, sensitive and accurate UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/LTQ MS combined with the data processing software “Compound Discoverer 3.3” and the AcquireXTM data acquisition workflow. In addition, further verification of the representative active metabolites was employed using molecular docking analysis. The Phase I metabolites of DMU-212 were mainly produced via demethylation, oxidation, desaturation, dehydration, reduction and hydration, while the major Phase II metabolites were methylation, acetylation, glucuronide, cysteine, glycine and glutamine conjugation products. As a result of this study, a simple method for studying drugs’ metabolism in vivo is provided, as is scientific and reliable support for a complete understanding of DMU-212’s metabolism and transformation. In addition, as a reference for the further development of new drugs, this is also important for a deeper understanding of the active constituents of DMU-212 and its action mechanisms for CRA prevention.

The synthesis of MEM was achieved through a similar route as previously described [31]. 2-Methoxyethoxymethyl chloride (6.10 g, 49.00 mmol) was added dropwise to 1-methyl imidazole (4.12 g, 50.10 mmol) dissolved in dry DCM (70 mL) in a Schlenk tube under inert atmosphere. After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the DCM was removed under vacuum, and the remaining IL washed several times with diethyl ether (≈50 mL) followed by removal of excess solvent under vacuum (≈0.05 mbar). A solution of Li[NTf2] (14.53 g, 52.20 mmol) in distilled water (20 mL) was then added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting IL (lower phase) was then separated and washed several times with distilled water (≈100 mL) until no precipitate of AgCl formed when aq. AgNO3 was added to the washing water. Finally, remaining water was removed by stirring the IL under vacuum (≈0.05 mbar) at 60 °C overnight.

The synthesis of CN was carried out following a previously described procedure [33]. 5-Chlorovaleronitrile (8.46 g, 71.90 mmol) was slowly added to 1-methyl imidazole (4.92 g, 59.90 mmol) and the mixture stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. Next, the temperature was increased to 110 °C for 24 h where after the resulting brownish-yellow liquid was washed several times with diethyl ether (≈50 mL) and then decolorized by stirring with a mixture of activated charcoal (0.7 g, 58.2 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL) overnight. After removal of the activated charcoal by filtration, Li[NTf2] (20.09 g, 69.9 mmol) in distilled water (20 mL) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting IL (lower phase) was then separated and washed several times with distilled water (≈100 mL) until no precipitate of AgCl formed when aq. AgNO3 was added to the washing water. Remaining water was removed by stirring the IL under vacuum (≈0.05 mbar) at 60 °C overnight.

Macamides 1–5 were detected by HPLC-DAD, with the highest peak corresponding to the respective macamide (Figure 4). These macamide peaks accounted for more than 95% of the total. The molecular formulas of these compounds were determined to be C23H39NO, C25H37NO, C26H41NO2, C25H39NO, and C26H39NO2, respectively, using ESI-MS (Figure 5a and Figure S1). The UV spectra of compounds 1–5 showed chromophores for a benzyl group (λmax 210 nm), and the IR spectra revealed absorptions at νmax 3302 cm−1 for N-H and νmax 1453 cm−1 for a carbonyl group (Figure 5b and Figure S2). The 13C NMR spectra exhibited an amide carbonyl peak (δC 173.13) and peaks corresponding to monosubstituted or polysubstituted benzene rings, as well as two or three disubstituted double bonds (δC 131.99, 130.27, 129.12, 128.44, 127.63, 126.96; each d; C-9, C-10, C-12, C-13, C-15, C-16, respectively) (Figure 5c and Figure S3). The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 5d and Figure S4) exhibited two or three cis-coupled olefinic protons at δ 5.37 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, H-9) and 5.36 (m, H-10), four other olefinic protons between δ 5.31 and 5.34 (m, H-12, H-13, H-15, and H-16), a primary methyl group at δ 0.87 (t, J = 4.0, 8.0, H-16) or δ 0.97 (t, J = 4.0, 8.0, H-18), as well as other protons between δ 1.30 and 1.33, assigned to the methylene group. Compared with macamide 1 (NBH), the other four compounds (2–5) contain two or three unsaturated double bonds and a 6-substituted phenyl ring replacing the methoxy group, which is verified in IR, MS, 1H, and 13C NMR spectra (Supplementary data).  2.2.

For 5-epi-α-bulnesene, 1H NMR resonances are available [26] for just =CH2 (δ 4.66) and the methyls at C-13 (δ 1.72), C-14 (δ 0.95), and C-15 (δ 1.67); the values obtained for compound 26 are, respectively: δ 4.73/4.70, 1.75, 0.98, and 1.58 with the resonance for CH3-15 differing by −0.09 ppm, out of line with the others that differ consistently by +0.03–0.05 ppm, potentially attributable to referencing methods. We considered a number of alternative structures that could reasonably arise from a more complex reductive rearrangement but none of these fit the COSY and HMBC data (Table 1 and Table 2; Supplementary Materials, pp. S15–S17) as well as the assigned structure; indeed, some of these are reported [61] and can be confidently excluded. Furthermore, apart from the C-7 resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum, all the 13C chemical shifts are within ~3 ppm of the values for authentic α-bulnesene (Figure 6); the aberrant C-7 resonance (43.5 vs. 51.0 for α-bulnesene in CDCl3; 43.8 vs. 51.2 for α-bulnesene in C6D6) is, however, not unreasonable when compared with that reported [62] for 4,5-di-epi-α-bulnesene (δ 43.5 in C6D6).  3.

This showed well-defined AB patterns of doublets at δ 4.02 and 4.17 ppm for CH2O and at δ 2.55 and 2.69 ppm for CH2C=O, both coupled to the CH between them which appeared as a multiplet at δ 3.26 ppm. The corresponding 13C NMR signals appeared, respectively, at δ 67.8, 29.9 and 45.3 ppm. The two lactone C=O groups gave a single IR absorption at 1789 cm−1 and a correct HRMS measurement was obtained. The relative and absolute configuration was confirmed by X-ray diffraction to be (S,S,S) (Figure 1). When this was subjected to FVP at 500 °C, there was almost complete reaction with loss of pivalaldehyde and CO to give, after preparative TLC, the lactone (4S)-4-benzoyltetrahydrofuran-2-one 15 in good yield. This showed good agreement with NMR chemical shift values from the literature and based on its optical rotation [21], the e.e. was 58%. [/INST],\n",

Its 1H NMR spectrum in methanol-d4 indicated the presence of two isolated methyl groups at δ 1.28 (s, 3H, H3-19) and 0.79 (s, 3H, H3-20) ppm, a methyl group adjacent to a methine at δ 0.86 (d, J = 6.7 Hz, 3H, H3-17) ppm, an olefinic proton at δ 6.65 (dd, J = 4.7, 2.8 Hz, 1H, H-3) ppm as well as three aromatic protons at δ 7.38 (t, J = 1.7 Hz, 1H, H-15), 7.26 (dt, J = 1.7, 0.9 Hz, 1H, H-16), and δ 6.29 (dd, J = 1.9, 0.9 Hz, 1H, H-14) ppm. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed 20 carbon resonances, including two overlapping signals at δ 144.0 (C-4, C-15), three methyl carbons at δ 21.1 (C-19), 18.8 (C-20) and 16.3 (C-17) ppm, four aromatic carbons at δ 144.0 (C-15), 139.7 (C-16), 126.9 (C-13), and 111.9 (C-14) ppm, two olefinic carbons at δ 144.0 (C-4) and 138.1 (C-3) ppm as well as one carboxylic carbon at δ 171.1 (C-18) ppm. Based on the spectral data along with the 2D homo- and heteronuclear correlations, the structure of Compound 1 was elucidated as hardwickiic acid, a trans-clerodane diterpenoid carboxylic acid bearing β-substituted furan moiety. (–)-Hardwickiic acid has been isolated from S. rugosa by Lu et al. [10,33], which allowed the deduction of its absolute configuration. The levorotatory enantiomer was supported by the observed negative sign of its specific rotation value (αD25 = −104.4 (c 0.4775, EtOH)), which is similar to the previously reported data (αD25 = −116.5 (c 1.09, EtOH), [34]). Furthermore, due to the lack of the reported NMR spectra recorded in the methanol-d4 solvent, the published NMR spectroscopic data of its antipode, ent-(+)-hardwickiic acid [35], was used for confirmation as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. The two spectra were in excellent agreement, which corroborated the proposed structure. [/INST],\n",

The IR spectrum of 2 showed absorption bands for hydroxy (3397 cm−1) and carbonyl (1708 cm−1) groups. The 13C-NMR and DEPT spectra revealed the presence of eleven carbon resonances ascribable to two methyls, three methylenes, five methines (two oxygenated at δC 71.8 and 78.3, and two olefinic at δC 131.8 and 137.8), and one carbonyl at δC 178.5. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2, signals ascribable to one methyl triplet, one methyl doublet, two oxygenated methine protons, and two olefinic protons could be well distinguished. The above-mentioned information suggested the existence of one di-substituted double bond and one carbonyl in 2, accounting for both the two degrees of unsaturation implied by the molecular formula. This deduction proposed that 2 was a chain carboxylic acid derivative. The structure of 2 was established by the detailed elucidation of the 2D-NMR spectra (Figure 2). In the 1H-1H COSY plots, the correlations of H3-9 (δH 1.12)/H-8 (δH 3.60), H-8 (δH 3.60)/H-7 (δH 3.81), H-7 (δH 3.81)/H-6 (δH 5.48), H-6 (δH 5.48)/H-5 (δH 5.46), H-5 (δH 5.46)/H-4, H-4/H2-10, H2-10/H3-11 (δH 0.90), and H2-2/H2-3 indicated the presence of two structural fragments in 2, namely CH3(9)-CH(8)-CH(7)-CH(6)-CH(5)-CH(4)-CH2(10)-CH3(11) and CH2(2)-CH2(3). The connection of CH2(3) and CH(4) was supported by the HMBC correlations from H2-3 to C-4 and C-5, as well as from H2-2 to C-4, in spite of the absence of 1H-1H COSY correlation between H2-3 and H-4. Additional HMBC correlations from H2-2 and H2-3 to the carbonyl anchored a carboxyl group at C-2. The chemical shifts of C-7 and C-8 in combination with the molecular formula suggested that both C-7 and C-8 were substituted by hydroxy groups for the α,β-unsaturated diol moiety in 2. A relatively large coupling constant (15.5 Hz) between H-5 and H-6 revealed the E configuration of the double bond. In order to determine the relative configuration of the vicinal diol, we tried to prepare the acetonide derivative of 2 by chemical derivatization. Unfortunately, it turned out to be futile by furnishing several products which were difficult to be separated, probably due to the instability of 2 under the reaction condition. Hence, the configuration of C-4, C-7, and C-8 in 2 remained undefined. Compound 2 was proposed to be biosynthesized via a PKS pathway incorporating a rare extender unit ethylmalonyl CoA.  2.2.

Infrared spectroscopy (IR) showed that the structure of the compound HM475 has a hydroxyl (3075.9 cm−1), hydrocarbon chain double bond (1643.05 cm−1), carbonyl (C = O) (1680.66 cm−1) and benzene ring (1496.4 cm−1, 1578.45 cm−1) (Figure S2, ESI). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, Figure S3, ESI): δ 3.07 (6H, s, H-14, H-15), 3.31 (2H, d, J = 6.5 Hz, H-3′), 3.38 (2H, d, J = 7.0 Hz, H-3), 4.72 (2H, s, H-10′), 4.76 (2H, s, H-10), 4.97–5.06 (4H, m, H-1, H-1′), 5.93–5.99 (2H, m, H-2, H-2′), 6.91 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-6, H-6′), 7.02 (1H, s, H-7′), 7.38 (1H, s, H-9) 7.49 (1H, s, H-9′), 7.06 (1H, s, H-5). 13C-NMR (125 MHz, DMSO-d6, Figure S3, ESI): 172.63 (C-11), 165.08 (C-11′), 166.55 (C-13), 170.32 (C-12), 153.54 (C-7), 127.40(C-7′), 138.05 (C-2′), 136.89 (C-2), 132.96 (C-4, C-4′), 131.86 (C-9), 130.84 (C-9′), 128.24 (C-5), 154.40 (C-5′), 128.24 (C-8, C-8′), 112.12 (C-6),113.86 (C-6′), 115.48 (C-1,C-1′), 70.45 (C-10), 65.87 (C-10′), 38.64 (C-3), 35.01 (C-3′), 35.64 (C-14, C-15). According to 1H-1H COSY (Figure S4, ESI) and HMBC (Figure S5, ESI), H-1 and H-2 of HM475 were coupled, and H-1 and C-3 were coupled, indicating that C-1 was connected to C-2, and C-2 was connected to C-3. Similarly, H-1′ coupling with H-2′, H-1′ coupling with C-3′, which indicated C-1′ was connected with C-2′ and C-2′ was connected with C-3′. In the Figure 2, COSY and HMBC H-5 of HM475 was coupled with H-6, H-5 was coupled with C-4 and C-7, H-6 was coupled with C-7 and C-5, H-9 is coupled with C-8 and C-7, which can confirm the structure of the A ring. Similarly, H-5′ coupling with C-6′ and C-7′, H-6′ coupling with C-7′ and C-8′, H-9′ is coupled with C-5′ and C-7′, so the structure of B ring can be confirmed. According to H-10 coupling with C-7 and C-11, H-14 coupling with C-13 and C-15, H-15 coupling with C-13 and C-14, the structure of triazine ring C ring can be determined.

After cool-down of the reaction mixture, most of the volatile compounds were removed under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was diluted with iso-propanol and separated by preparative HPLC (0.02% aq. NH4Ac: ACN; 0–8.20 min: 70:30; 8.20–11 min: 40:60; 11-11.20 min: 40:60; 11.20-16 min: 70:30; 16–40 min 70:30; flow: 20 mL/min). Fractions containing one of the product isomers were combined separately, and solvents were removed under reduced pressure and subsequently freeze-dried. Both isomers of lysergic acid hydrazide ((5R,8R)-isomer (0.059 g, 0.21 mmol, 21%); (5R,8S)-isomer (0.047 g, 0.17 mmol, 15%)) were obtained as gray solids.

NaOtBu (1.5 equiv, 9.32 mmol, 0.896 g) was dissolved in THF (60 mL) and subsequently added to a solution of mPEO1.9 (1.0 equiv, 6.29 mmol, 12.0 g) in THF (60 mL). After 72 h, epichlorohydrin (8.0 equiv, 50.3 mmol, 4.65 g, 3.94 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction within 15 min and stirred for six days. Subsequently, the volatile components were removed at 55 °C under vacuum and the solid residue was dissolved in THF. Undissolved components, mainly formed sodium chloride (NaCl), were removed by centrifugation (Sigma 3-18KS, Osterode am Harz, Germany, 10000 rpm for 10 min), followed by filtration with syringe filter (PTFE membrane, pore size = 0.2 µm, VWR) and drying at room temperature under vacuum. Afterwards, the product was dissolved in a little amount of toluene at 40 °C, precipitated into cold Et2O and collected by centrifugation as before. This process was repeated three times. The resulting EmPEO1.9 was dried at 30 °C under vacuum < 1 × 10−6 mbar (yield: 89–93%). The product was characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

Succinctly, the synthesis consisted of two ion exchange reactions, which were carried out in a thermostatically controlled vessel at 0 °C. At the first stage, choline hydroxide (ChOH) was obtained by mixing 15.245 g of ChCl and 30 wt% KOH solution in methanol. In the second stage, the ChOH solution was mixed with 8.656 g of acrylic acid (AA) (taken in a small excess). The residual ChCl content in ChA was evaluated using the gravimetric method by carefully collecting, drying and weighing the KCl obtained at the first stage. It was found that the yield of KCl was 98 wt%. Thus, the content of unreacted ChCl can be estimated as 1.6 wt%. Further, methanol was distilled from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C and reduced pressure. After the removal of methanol, the temperature was raised to 70 °C to remove excess AA. As a result, a white gel-like liquid was obtained. The chemical structure of the synthesized ChA was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy using the NMR Fourier spectrometer AVANCE II-500WB (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). D2O was used as a solvent. The spectra were the same as those reported earlier in [40].  2.2.2. Measurement of Solvent Density [/INST],\n",

Oxalyl chloride (0.926 mL, 10.94 mmol, 1 equiv) was added, followed by the addition of DMF (0.11 mL), which resulted in vigorous gas evolution. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to generate the acid chloride intermediate. After 1 h, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, yielding the acid chloride as a pale-yellow oil. The acid chloride was redissolved in anhydrous THF (10 mL) and concentrated again by rotary evaporation. The acid chloride was then dissolved in anhydrous THF (27 mL) and placed under nitrogen atmosphere. In a flame-dried 50 mL pear flask, 4-iodobenzyl of alcohol (2.56 g, 10.94 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (23 mL) and Et3N (1.68 mL, 12.03 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added. This solution was then transferred to the reaction flask containing the acid chloride via cannula. The pear flask was rinsed with anhydrous THF (2 mL × 2) and each rinse was transferred to the reaction flask. The reaction was then stirred at room temperature for 20 h, after which it was filtered through Celite and rinsed with EtOAc. After concentration via rotary evaporation, the resulting crude reaction mixture was purified by flash silica gel column chromatography (100% hexanes to 50:50 hexanes/EtOAc) to yield the product as a white solid in 76% yield (3.13 g).

The NMR spectra of 4NSG were observed using 1H and 13C NMR, and the results observed were consistent with reported data [24] (see Fig. 2a, SF1 (A-C)). The 1H NMR peaks were 10.88 ppm (-CO–NH), and 1.38 – 1.04 ppm (-CH2-)15, representing the amide linkage and long-chain methylene group contributed by stearic acid, respectively. The formed amide bond in 4NSG revealed a characteristic 13C NMR peak at 174.55 ppm, confirming the presence of an amide bond between stearic acid and Gem. Based on micro elemental analysis results, (Calculated: C = 59.21; H = 8.65; N = 7.67; F = 6.94 compared to with Found: C = 59.27; H = 8.59; N = 7.51; F = 6.67), the purity of 4NSG was found to be 99.8%, and this result is similar to our HPLC purity analysis of 4NSG which was 99.8%. Mass spectrometer analysis of 4NSG was performed, and Supplementary Fig. 1C shows representative mass spectra obtained for 4NSG. The observed two fragments of 4NSG showed similar peak intensity, however; the m/z ratios of the fragments occurred at 530.59 and 1059.37.

Its IR absorptions revealed the presence of hydroxy (3429 cm−1) and carbonyl (1733 cm−1) groups. The UV absorption band maximum at λmax 283 nm and five downfield-shifted carbon signals at δC 169.8 (C-16), 163.8 (C-13), 149.3 (C-12), 111.6 (C-11), and 109.6 (C-15) in the 13C NMR data suggested the presence of the α,β-butenolide ring conjugated with one extra double bond [12]. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), the resonances for four methyls [δH 1.30 (3H, s, H3-17), 0.90 (3H, s, H3-18), 0.85 (3H, s, H3-20), and 0.83 (3H, s, H3-19)], two olefinic protons [δH 6.03 (1H, br s, H-15) and 5.86 (1H, br s, H-11)] were observed. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra, combined with HMQC correlations (Table 1) showed 20 resonances for carbon signals accounting for four methyls, five sp3 methylenes, five methines (two olefinics at δC 111.6, 109.6), and six quaternary carbons (one carbonyl at δC 169.8, two olefinics at δC 163.8, 149.3, and one oxygenated sp3 at δC 72.2). The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of 1 showed great similarity to those of 12α,14β-dihydroxycassa-13(15)-en-12,16-olide (2) isolated from Caesalpinia bonduc [18]. The difference evident was that compound 1 displayed an extended conjugate π-system with an α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone ring.

To a mixture of water and acid (100mL of water and 50 mL of 37% HCl) in a round bottom flask, 0.1 mol of ethylamine and 0.4 mole of phosphorous acid were added. The mixture was stirred to dissolve the contents and then refluxed for 2 hours. To the reaction, formaldehyde (37%, 0.4 mol) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was refluxed for a further 4 hours. After this period, the obtained solution was cooled at room temperature. Subsequently, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Ethanol was added to the concentrated solution, which produced a white precipitate. The product was obtained by filtration, washed with ethanol, and then dried under vacuum. The synthesis scheme is shown in Fig. (1).  The structure was characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and IR spectroscopy. 2.1.1 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopy  Samples were dissolved in D2O.

From this library, SRP-001 was chemically synthesized using readily available commercial analytical grade reagents of the highest quality, which were purchased and used without further purification. Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on 0.25 mm E. Merck silica gel plates (60FS-254) using UV light for visualization to monitor all reaction steps. We performed column chromatography using silica gel (60 F254, 70–200 mm) as the stationary phase and determined all melting points in open capillary tubes on a Stuart Scientific SMP3 melting point apparatus. Varian Gemini 200, Varian Mercury VX-300, Varian Unity 300, or Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometers were used to record 1H and 13C NMR spectra at room temperature. Chemical shifts are given in ppm (δ) downfield from TMS. Coupling constants (J) are in hertz (Hz), and signals are described as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; br, broad; m, multiplet; ap, apparent, etc. Mestrenova 6.0.2 software was used to analyze the NMR FIDs.

This design of HAPPI with the multivalent presentation of VBPs and CBPs, targets them to the vascular injury sites, recruits activated platelets, and promotes their adhesion, thereby promoting the formation of a vascular plug and inducing hemostasis (Figure 1). The highly localized presence of the targeted molecules (e.g., vWF and collagen) ensures that these events occur only at the injury sites without causing systemic clotting. We posit that this facilitates HAPPI as a safe and effective treatment strategy with high translational feasibility for life‐threatening, noncompressible traumatic bleeding. [/INST],\n",

Experimental 1H VF/MAS NMR and 13C ssNMR (VF/MAS and CP/MAS for PANI and MOFs, respectively) spectra of pristine materials (Figure 8a,c,e) were attributed based on the literature data67−69 and supported the proposed structures (Figure 8, middle panel). New signals, marked as HPANI, were observed in the 1H VF/MAS NMR spectra (Figure 8b,d right-hand panel), confirming the incorporation of PANI into MOFs in PANI-MOF composites. Moreover, the comparison of 1H VF/MAS NMR spectra of pristine MOFs and PANI-MOF composites, clearly indicates that Zr–OH groups interact with PANI chains. It could be attributed to the participation of MOF in the protonation of PANI, which agrees with the vibrational spectroscopy data, showing increased protonation of PANI in the composites compared to that in the pristine polymer, synthesized in the absence of MOFs. The corresponding 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra show that PANI in the PANI-MOF composites can be partially hydrolyzed,70 which is manifested by new carbonyl signals at ca. 173.5 ppm. Furthermore, according to a comparison of NMR patterns in Figure 8 (left-hand panel), 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra also indicate different behavior of PANI in the composites with different MOFs. In the case of PANI-UiO-66, the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum shows a significant broadening of the detected signals and a noticeable shift of the peak corresponding to −CH< aromatic carbons. The broadening of the NMR signals indicates immobilization of the respective moieties, and the change in position of the −CH< aromatic carbons peak suggests that they are involved in physical interaction. On the contrary, in the case of PANI-UiO-66-NH2, a broad −CH< signal, corresponding to PANI, overlaps the signals of aromatic carbons of the UiO-66-NH2 template. Moreover, the almost missing signal at 150.5 ppm (marked C1) clearly indicates that −NH2 groups, present in pristine UiO-66-NH2, are affected by the polymerization of aniline, which can likely be attributed to the grafting of PANI chains to the UiO-66-NH2 skeleton.  Figure 8 Experimental 13C ssNMR spectra (left-hand panel), schematic representation of the organic species (middle panel), and 1H VF/MAS NMR spectra (right-hand panel) of (a) UiO-66, (b) PANI-UiO-66, (c) UiO-66-NH2, (d) PANI-UiO-66-NH2, and (e) PANI, synthesized in the absence of MOFs. The peaks corresponding to residual solvent (DMF) and impurity are marked by * and ‡, respectively. The full-range experimental 13C ssNMR spectra in the original scale are depicted in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). [/INST],\n",

The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, which was monitored by TLC, the reaction mixture was brought to 0°C and quenched by slow addition of 0.03 mL of water, followed by 0.03 mL of 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and 0.03 mL of water; the resulting mixture was then warmed to ambient temperature, stirred for 30 min and filtered. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford crude product. The crude product was further purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, 30% EtOAc in hexane) to afford the pure product as a white solid. The solid was dissolved in diethyl ether and cooled to 0 °C. 2M HCl solution in diethyl ether (∼0.1 mL) was added and the resulting mixture stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with diethyl ether to afford a white solid (yield: 64%).  1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Linux workstation running on vNMRj software. All the spectra were phased; baseline was corrected where necessary, and solvent signals (CDCl3) were used as reference for both 1H and 13C spectra.

The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, which was monitored by TLC, the reaction mixture was brought to 0°C and quenched by slow addition of 0.03 mL of water, followed by 0.03 mL of 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and 0.03 mL of water; the resulting mixture was then warmed to ambient temperature, stirred for 30 min and filtered. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford crude product. The crude product was further purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, 30% EtOAc in hexane) to afford the pure product as a white solid. The solid was dissolved in diethyl ether and cooled to 0 °C. 2M HCl solution in diethyl ether (∼0.1 mL) was added and the resulting mixture stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with diethyl ether to afford a white solid (yield: 64%). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Linux workstation running on vNMRj software. All the spectra were phased; baseline was corrected where necessary, and solvent signals (CDCl3) were used as reference for both 1H and 13C spectra.

The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h. TLC examination (2% MeOH in NH3-saturated CHCl3) indicated the completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was then carefully quenched by a very slow drop-wise addition of saturated Na2SO4 until the evolution of H2 ceased. The reaction mixture was then filtered over celite 545, and the filtrate was washed with EtOAc (100 mL). The combined filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, redissolved in EtOAc (100 mL), and dried over Na2SO4. The drying agent was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain the amine product as a light-yellow oil. This product was dissolved in ether (4 mL) and treated with 2N.

The total ion chromatogram (TIC) and extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) are reported in Figure 1 and show only the presence of the peaks corresponding to the expected PEGDE oligomers. The overlayed PEGDE and blank chromatograms (TIC in Figure 1A) show that no other extra peak was identified.  PEGDE was also analyzed through pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) by using a multi-shot pyrolyzer. The first shot was performed at 300 °C, while the second one was performed at 600 °C, as reported in Figure 2. The temperatures chosen for the double-shot pyrolysis are based on standard conditions used for polymer analysis, as it is generally acknowledged that no reactions occur at 300 °C, except for the dehydration reaction, so it is possible to obtain an easy-to-interpret pyrogram that allows to identify any small polluting organic molecules, while decomposition products of the PEGDE oligomers can be observed at 600 °C.  The mass spectra of selected peaks of the pyrogram in the first and second shot are reported in Figure S1. All the peaks have similar mass spectra, no impurities or unexpected peaks were identified, the m/z ratios associated to each chromatographic peaks are the same both for the first and second shot, and all the ions can be associated to the fragmentation of the PEGDE chain, as explained in Figure 2 and Figure S3 (Supporting Information). Finally, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were also recorded to further support the purity of the product. Both spectra conform to the expected PEGDE signals and, for 1H spectrum, multiplicity (see Figure 3).

The catalytic performance was tested in an H-type cell using 20 mL of 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 0.2 mmol cyclohexanone and 2 mmol NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve shows an enhanced current density after the addition of cyclohexanone and NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 5). After 4000 s of electrolysis at different potentials, the products were analysed and quantified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry (GC‒MS), and gas chromatography (GC). Interestingly, cyclohexanone oxime was identified as the only organic product. All the peaks at 2.4, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.5 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 2) and 160.7, 32.1, 26.8, 25.7, 25.5, and 24.4 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 3) match well with the cyclohexanone oxime standard sample. Additionally, the molecular weight of 113.1 given by GC‒MS further confirms the successful synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). A 92% yield, 99% selectivity (in terms of C), 26% FE, and 0.165 mmol h−1 cm−2 formation rate of cyclohexanone oxime are obtained at the optimum potential of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and NH4+ is the major byproduct (Fig. 2d, e, Supplementary Figs. 9–12 and Supplementary Note 4). The performance is better than that of the pure Cu catalyst (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14 and Supplementary Note 5). Then, the reaction process is monitored (Fig. 2f). Cyclohexanone is consumed completely within 4000 s, and the yield of cyclohexanone oxime shows an opposite tendency compared to cyclohexanone. Then, a preliminary techno-economic analysis (TEA) on plant-gate levelized cost per tonne of cyclohexanone oxime was performed (Supplementary Note 6). The electrosynthesis strategy is much more profitable at the optimum condition of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a given electricity price of 10 cents kWh−1 (the price of electricity generated from renewable sources is 3 cents kWh−1) (Fig. 2g)24, showing the industrial application potential of this electrosynthesis strategy. Notably, 10-fold molar equivalents of NaNO2 were used to realize the rapid synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, and the cost should be further decreased by improving the utilization of NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 15). Subsequently, the durability of the catalyst was assessed, and the performance and catalyst structure were well maintained during 50 cyclic tests, showing the good stability of the Cu-S catalyst (Fig. 2h) (Supplementary Figs. 16, 17).Fig. 2 Performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis over a Cu-S cathode.

In addition, citrinin, an inhibitor of the QS system of P. aeruginosa, was isolated from the marine fungus Penicillium sp. JH1 found in the coastal waters of Qingdao (China). The inhibitory effect of citrinin on the production of rhamnolipid was better than that of elastase and pyocyanin. Compared with non-mucoid P. aeruginosa PAO1, citrinin inhibited the biofilm formation of mucoid P. aeruginosa FRD1 more significantly and therefore has the potential to treat clinical infections. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that citrinin significantly inhibited the transcription of las, rhl and pqs system-related genes. In addition, the results of heterologous expression in E. coli showed that citrinin had the strongest inhibitory effect on the las system. Molecular docking results showed that citrinin bound to PqsR and LasR with better affinity than the natural ligands. The present study is the first to report the anti-QS effect of citrinin.

JH1 was cultured in 40 L fungal medium at 30 °C for 30 days. The solid fermentation product was extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate and was dried by a rotary evaporator. The crude extract was fractionated by using a silica gel gradient vacuum liquid chromatography column, eluting with petroleum ether, and a step gradient of CH2Cl2/MeOH (v/v 100:1, 70:1, 50:1, 30:1 and 10:1). Based on thin layer chromatography analysis, six fractions were obtained. Fraction 3 obtained from CH2Cl2/MeOH (v/v = 50:1) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 chromatography with MeOH to afford 60 subfractions (S.1–S.60). Analyzed by TLC, 11 subfractions (S.27–S.37) had anti-QS activity. After being freeze dried and dissolved with acetonitrile, subfraction S.30 was analyzed for purity using a C18 reverse phase chromatographic column with acetonitrile and water as the mobile phase and was detected by 25 min fingerprinting (the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the gradient curve was a linear gradient from 10% to 100% acetonitrile over 20 min, then a linear gradient from 100% to 10% acetonitrile over 5 min and the column temperature was 30 °C). The purity of the compound was found to be high, greater than 95%. A small number of subfraction S.30 freeze-dried samples were dissolved in methanol and deuterated DMSO, respectively, followed by mass spectrometry and NMR.

The characteristics of coumarin derivatives are evident in the 13C-NMR spectrum of the scopoletin compound, as shown in Table 1. The spectrum contains 10 signals for carbon atoms, including a carbonyl signal (δC (C=O)) at 164.2 ppm on an aromatic ring that is located next to an electron-withdrawing group in the form of oxygen. In addition, there are 4 other Cq signals that shifted values, δC 152.9, δC 151.4, δC 147.3, and δC 112.4 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, the signal of the methoxy carbon in the aromatic ring is at a shift of δC 56.7 ppm. Next, the signals at δC 113.0, δC 146.1, δC 109.9, and δC 104.0 ppm are aromatic carbon signals, each representing one methine carbon (C-H) with a shift in position, indicating the group of coumarin compounds [14]. In the 1H-NMR data, the singlet at δH 3.87 ppm indicates three protons of the methoxy group (H-11). The following doublets at 6.14 ppm (1H, J = 11.5 Hz) and 7.81 ppm (1H, J = 11.5 Hz) confirm the presence of H-3 and H-4 protons of the coumarin skeleton.

Aucubin is a glycoside whose aglycone (i.e., aucubigenin) binds to the glucose group using an O-glycosidic bond. Phytochemical screening of aucubin in a plant can be performed with the Trim–Hill color test, and the process is as follows: First, the plant material is cut into small sizes and put into a test tube containing 5 mL of 1% HCl. After 3–6 h, 0.1 mL of the extract was collected and put into another tube containing 1 mL of Trim–Hill reagent (i.e., a mixture of 10 mL of acetic acid, 1 mL of 0.2% CuSO4·5H2O in water, and 0.5 mL of concentrated HCl). Then, the tube is heated using fire for a short time, and the solution turns blue in the presence of aucubin [9]. Ultraviolet absorption spectra can detect some properties and reactions of aucubin. Generally, aucubin neither reacts with FeCl3, as evidenced by the absence of color change, nor reduces Fehling’s solution. However, this substance reduces the Tollens’ AgNO3 reagent slowly at cool temperatures and in a few seconds when heated to 100 °C. The UV spectrum of aucubin in MeOH has λmax of 204 nm, and the IR spectrum (KBr) gives υmax between 3629 and 1666 cm−1, indicative of O-H and C=C, respectively. Meanwhile, the LC-ESIMS spectrum of aucubin presents m/z of 368 [M + Na]+ calculated for C21H32O13.

In the NMR spectra of folic acid NHS-ester characteristic signals from the pteroyl partial structure and the glutamic acid structure of folic acid as well as a pronounced signal from the NHS-ester at δ 2.57 ppm (1H-NMR) and δ 25.18 ppm (13C-NMR) were observed. Upon analysis of the BrijS20-amine building block, strong signals from the PEG moiety (1H-NMR: δ 3.53–3.88 ppm and 13C-NMR: δ 69.72 ppm), as well as the alkyl structure (1H-NMR: δ 1.58–0.91 ppm and 13C-NMR: δ 26.23–13.94 ppm), were detected. Additionally, a peak originating from the CH2 group next to the ester moiety and signals from the CH2 groups neighboring the primary and secondary amine was observed. The final BrijS20-amine-folic acid conjugate contained signals from the PEG- and alkyl structure characteristic for the Brij-component as well as distinctive signals from the pteroyl- and glutamic acid structures of folic acid, therefore indicating the successful conjugation. Yet, despite a lengthy purification procedure, signals from residual HEPES buffer were detected in the NMR spectra of the final BrijS20-amine folic acid conjugate. Also, triethylamine was not entirely removed from the folic acid NHS-ester intermediate product. Therefore, to improve accuracy, further experiments are focusing on increasing the efficiency of the purification process. These impurities, however, did not seem to interfere with the reproducible formation of folic acid-targeted nanoparticles. [/INST],\n",

In the 1H NMR spectrum of VSi-CHO shown in Figure S1, the peak at 9.83 ppm corresponds with -CHO (Ha), the peaks at 6.95–8.00 ppm belong to aromatic hydrogen protons, and the peaks at 3.51–3.92 ppm are attributed to -OCH3 (Hb). In the 1H NMR spectrum of DPBSi, the single peak at 10.34 ppm is attributed to -NH (Ha) in the benzimidazole ring and the signal of -NH (Hb) is linked to the benzimidazole ring that appears at 9.03 ppm, while the peak of -CH arises at 5.32–5.40 ppm and the peaks of hydrogen protons on benzene rings appear at 6.58–8.42 ppm [35]. Compared with the 1H NMR spectra of VSi-CHO, the peaks of -CHO disappear, while there are similar peaks of -OCH3 (Hd) at 3.68–3.79 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of DPBSi. More importantly, the integral area ratio of hydrogen atoms is generally consistent with the theoretical ratio in VSi-CHO and DPBSi. By comparing the 31P NMR spectra in Figure 2b, it is distinct that the two products display different chemical shifts. DOPO shows two peaks at 14.51 ppm and 15.72 ppm, whereas DPBSi shows two phosphorus signals at 29.07 ppm and 31.29 ppm. As shown in Figure 2c, a total of 29 carbon signals in DPBSi are confirmed, including several key carbon signals (C1 = 56.03 ppm, C2 = 66.83 ppm, C6 = 149.56 ppm, C7 = 147.72 ppm, and C16 = 131.31 ppm).

A mixture of acetic anhydride (20 mL, 0.21 mol) and formic acid (10 mL, 0.25 mol) was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h, then cooled to 0 °C. To the solution was added 3-chloro-4-methylaniline 1 (15 g, 0.11 mol) dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 18 h. After dilution with ethyl ether (Et2O, 50 mL) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 25 mL), the mixture was washed with water (2 × 50 mL) followed by 1 N aqueous NaOH (3 × 50 mL) and brine (3 × 50 mL), dried over MgSO4.

Over the course of 15 min, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (88 mL, 505.3 mmol) was added dropwise at a temperature not exceeding −7 °C. The mixture was stirred for 90 min at −10 °C. An amount of 1200 mL of pre-cooled (0–5 °C) ethyl acetate was then added over 30 min with the temperature being maintained at −10 °C, and finally 800 mL of ice water was added, which raised the temperature to 0–5 °C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with 600 mL ethyl acetate at 0–5 °C. The combined organic phase was extracted twice, each time with a cold mixture of 320 mL 6% aqueous NaCl solution and 80 mL 2N hydrochloric acid. Finally, the organic phase was extracted with 400 mL phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0. The organic phase was separated, filtered to clarify, and the filter then washed with 40 mL of ethyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated to 360 g at 40 °C and made up to 440 g with fresh ethyl acetate. The solution was stirred for 18 h at 20 °C in order to crystallize the crude bis-protected meropenem (4). In order to complete the crystallization, 140 mL of heptane were added dropwise, and the slurry was stirred for a further 30 min. The product was isolated by filtration, washed twice, each time with 200 mL of heptane, and dried for 16 h at 40 °C under vacuum to give the crude title compound (4) (101.2 g, 91.8% yield) as an off-white solid. The HPLC assay gave a result of 98.3%. Purification: crude bis-protected meropenem (4, 100 g, 143.3 mmol) was dissolved in 1680 mL ethyl acetate. The slurry was stirred at 20 °C for 90 min. An amount of 140 mL cyclohexane was added in order to complete the crystallization and the slurry was stirred for 2.5 h. The pure bis-protected meropenem (4) was isolated via filtration, washed with 200 mL cyclohexane, and dried for 16 h at 40 °C under vacuum to give the pure title compound (4) as a white solid (91.1 g, 91.1% yield).

Meanwhile, the carbonyl bond in curcumin underwent keto-enol tautomerism due to the hydroxyl group in methanol, forming a new C=C double bond (blue ellipses in Fig. 1a). Such modifications were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic resonance of the phenolic hydroxyl group (δ = 9.65 ppm) has disappeared by adding sodium to curcumin, indicating the substitution of H+. The formation of the C=C double bond was evidenced by the changes in the alkene signal (δ = 5.93 ppm), where a new signal peak representing the trisubstituted alkene was developed (Fig. 1b). The full spectrum of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR are available in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The existence of Na was determined by the 23Na-NMR spectrum (see Supplementary Fig. 3). The molecular weight measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is 434, identical to that of the structural formula (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). The synthetic Cur-Na is a multifunctional additive that can be incorporated into bioink to improve printing quality. To verify its suitability for light-based 3D bioprinting, the light absorbance and water solubility were initially assessed experimentally. As shown in the absorbance spectra (Supplementary Fig. 5), Cur-Na demonstrated excellent light attenuation capability due to the absorbance peak (~425 nm) near 405 nm, a wavelength commonly used in light-based 3D bioprinting owing to its low detrimental effects on cells compared with UV light (e.g., 365 nm)37,38. Thus, Cur-Na can be used as a photoabsorber to effectively prevent over-curing layers, improving vertical printing resolution. In addition, Cur-Na has a water solubility of as large as 51 mg mL−1, making it well-suited for formulating water-containing bioink. Solution with low-concentration biomaterials (e.g., PEGDA and GelMA) and high water content is favourable for bioprinting because of the high bio-performance and good fluidity34,35. When Cur-Na monomers are dissolved in such a diluted bioink, the reactive functional groups (three C=C double bonds of alkene) can participate in the chain-growth reaction, offering extra controllability to the fundamental polymerisation process. Such a mechanism is of great importance in improving printing quality, which will be explained in detail in the section of photoinhibiting mechanism.Fig. 1 Synthesis of curcumin-Na. [/INST],\n",

Briefly, the aim compound showed same molecular ions with podophyllotoxin and picropodophyllotoxin, but the retention time and the major fragment ions were different from the two reference standards, suggesting the aim compound was an isomer of these two standards. LC-TOF–MS analysis of both commercial BTW extract and original BTW herb confirmed the presence of this isomer. Analysis using 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR revealed the aim compound as β-peltatin with molecular formula C22H22O8 and molecular weight 414.4. [/INST],\n",

The 5,10-dipyridyl (15,20-diphenyl)porphyrin (56 mg, 9.08 × 10−5 mol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in pyridine (40 mL) under argon and then a solution of POBr3 (1.38 g, 4.81 mmol, 53 equiv) in pyridine (10 mL) was added dropwise under stirring. The reaction mass was refluxed for 2 h under argon, cooled to room temperature, and poured into the mixture of water (1 L) and DCM (200 mL). The reaction mass was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, then the organic layer was isolated and washed with distilled water (5 × 500 mL). Next, the purple organic layer was diluted with 100 mL of n-hexane and poured on a silica gel chromatography column without evaporation of solvents. Increasing the polarity of the eluent (DCM-methanol) up to 15% of MeOH gave a crude product that was subsequently purified on Bio-Beads S-X3 (eluent - chloroform-methanol 95:5) and Bio-Beads S-X1 (eluent - chloroform-methanol 97.5:2.5) columns affording 40 mg of the pure compound 3(OH) 2 as a purple solid in 53% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3+CD3OD, 600 MHz): δ 7.67 (m, 6H CHPh meta/para), 7.91 (d, 3 J = 7.2 Hz, 4H, CHPh ortho), 7.91 (d, 3 J = 7.2 Hz, 4H, CHPh ortho), 7.96 (d, 3 J = 5.0 Hz, 4H, CHPy ortho), 8.82 (m, 6H, CHPy ortho/β-pyrrolic), 8.85 (d, 4 J P-H = 2.4 Hz, 2H, CH β-pyrrolic), 8.90 (d, 4 J P-H = 2.4 Hz, 2H, CH β-pyrrolic), 8.93 (dd, 3 J = 5.3 Hz, 4 J P-H = 2.4 Hz, 2H, CH β-pyrrolic). 31P NMR (CDCl3+CD3OD, 243 MHz): δ −191. 13C NMR (CD3OD, 151 MHz): δ 113.2 (C), 118.0 (C), 129.2 (CH), 129.8 (CH), 130.7 (CH), 133.5 (CH, 3 J P-C = 4.7 Hz), 133.9 (CH, 3 J P-C = 4.7 Hz), 134.5 (CH, 3 J P-C = 4.7 Hz), 134.6 (CH), 134.9 (CH, 3 J P-C = 4.7 Hz), 137.4 (C), 139.4 (C), 139.5 (C), 140.5 (C), 140.6 (C), 146.6 (C), 150.0 (CH). λ max (nm) (logε, mol−1 L cm−1) 427 (5.24), 553 (4.05), 589 (3.35).

Specifically, NaBH4 (9 g, 238.5 mmol) was added to a solution of CC3 cage (2 g, 1.76 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:1 v/v, 400 mL) at 0 °C. The ice-water bath was removed, and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 29 h. The solvent was removed under a reduced vacuum using a rotary evaporator until a gel-like product was obtained. The off-white solid was dispersed into deionized (DI) water (100 mL), extracted with DCM (40 mL), and washed with DI water (3 × 150 mL). The DCM phase was collected, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated under a vacuum using a rotary evaporator. The obtained off-white RCC3 (quant.) was dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight. To purify the obtained RCC3, in a 500 mL flask, 1 g of crude RCC3 was dissolved in 100 mL of acetone. The solution was covered and left to stand. Crystals started appearing on the wall of the flask after 30 min. The crystals were collected after 48 h by centrifugation and then dissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane and methanol mixture (v/v, 1/1) by continuous stirring. About 1 mL of DI water was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for another 72 h. After the removal of the solvents, the pure RCC3 (600 mg, 60%) was recovered and used for the preparation of the cage aqueous solutions. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ 7.10 (12H, s), 3.83 (12H, d, J = 14.0 Hz), 3.56 (12H, d, J = 14.1 Hz), 2.18 (12H, d, J = 8.9 Hz), 1.97 (12H, d, J = 12.7 Hz), 1.62 (12H, d, J = 8.4 Hz), 1.17–1.12 (12H, m), 0.97–0.94 (12H, m); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz): δ 141.38, 125.08, 61.40, 50.75, 31.79, 25.08.

The 1H and 13C NMR (Table 1) data indicated that the presence of two aromatic rings [δH 7.56 (d, J = 8.6 Hz), 7.19 (d, J = 2.1 Hz), 7.08 (d, J = 8.6 Hz), 7.04 (d, J = 2.1 Hz), δC 115.5, 131.9, 135.8, 158.9, 114.6, 143.9, 121.6, 136.0, 124.8, 130.7, 146.6, and 161.0], three methoxy groups (δH 3.88, 3.37, and 3.35, δC 63.0, 53.6, and 53.5), an ester carbonyl group (δC 161.8), three aliphatic methyls [δH 2.32 (s), 0.97 (d, J = 6.5 Hz), 0.94 (d, J = 6.7 Hz), δC 21.1, 21.9, and 23.6], three methines [δH 5.81 (s), 5.07 (dd, J = 9.2, 4.0 Hz), 1.78 (m), δC 98.8, 67.0, 25.1], and a methylene [δH 1.64 (ddd, J = 14.2, 9.2, 5.1 Hz), 1.44 (ddd, J = 14.2, 8.8, 4.0 Hz), δC 47.6] by comprehensive analysis of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC). The aforementioned 1H and 13C NMR (Table 1) data which were similar to those of purpactin C′ (11) revealed that 1 could be a depsidone derivative (Chen et al. 2015). The main differences were the absence of the signals of an aldehyde and an acetyl in 1. Instead, it was found to be the presence of two methoxyls and a methine. The heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) correlations from H3-13 (δH 3.37) and H3-14 (δH 3.35) to C-10a (δC 98.8) confirmed the presence of a dimethyl acetal unit in 1 and the HMBC correlations from H-10a (δH 5.81) to C-5 (δC 124.8) and C-8a (δC 146.6) indicated the dimethyl acetal unit was at C-10a. The 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) displayed one isolated proton spin system for the isoamyl group as shown in Fig. 2. The chemical shift of H-1′ [δH 5.05 (dd, J = 9.2, 4.0 Hz)] in 1 implied the presence of a hydroxyl at C-1′ instead of 1′-acetyl group by combined analysis of its HRESIMS data. The configuration of C-1′ was determined on the basis of the Mosher’s method (Zhang et al. 2013). Treatment of 1 with (R)- and (S)-α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl) phenylacetyl chloride (MTPA-Cl) gave the (S)- and (R)-MTPA esters (1a and 1b), respectively. The 1H NMR signals of two MTPA esters were assigned. The absolute configuration was determined to be 1′S by the calculation of Δδ(S-R) values (Fig. 3A). Thus, the structure of 1 was assigned as shown and it was named as talaronin A.Table 1 1H and 13C NMR data of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 (600 and 150 MHz, δ in × 10–6)  1 (CDCl3)\t2 (CDCl3)\t3 (MeOH-d4)\t4 (CDCl3) No\tδH (J, Hz)\tδC, type\tδH (J, Hz)\tδC, type\tδH (J, Hz)\tδC, type\tδH (J, Hz)\tδC, type [/INST],\n",

The TBA cations were then replaced with sodium ion to get Na3[MnMo6O18(C19H30O11N5)2] (abbrev. as SMMM) for further substitution of cationic ligand in the next procedure. The stepped modifications to the initial cluster and the chemical compositions of the obtained intermediates and product were carefully characterized by means of organic elemental analysis, 1H NMR, and mass spectra. The organic precursor 4′‐[4‐(2‐bromoethyloxy)phenyl]‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine was synthesized following similar procedures in the literature.[ 27 , 55 ] It was then used to prepare the cationic ligand 1‐(2‐(4‐([2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridin]‐4′‐yl) phenoxy) ethyl) pyridine bromide (abbrev. as Py‐TPY) by the reaction with pyridine. The product was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization time‐of‐flight (MALDI‐TOF) mass spectroscopy. The ionic complex was prepared by mixing SMMM with Py‐TPY in aqueous solution according to a full charge ratio through a simple ion replacement. The formed precipitate was filtrated and washed with water three times under sonication.  Characterization of Ionic POM Complex The obtained final product in a chemical formula of (Py‐TPY)3[MnMo6O18(C19H30O11N5)2] (abbrev. as PMMM) was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, inorganic and organic elemental analysis. Because the cluster part is in a disk‐like shape with two mannose groups grafting on both sides covalently, three Py‐TPY ligand counter cations attach SMMM around equatorial side evenly. Due to the increased hydrophobicity caused by charge neutralization of Py‐TPY, the formed ionic complex becomes less soluble in aqueous solution. Therefore, in the following structural characterizations, mixed solvent of DMSO and H2O (1:1 in volume ratio) was used to get satisfied solubility. All the data are summarized in the Supporting Information (Schemes S1–S3, Figures S1–S9, and Tables S1–S3, Supporting Information).  Conflict of Interest [/INST],\n",

The final product of the reaction (biodiesel) was obtained employing optimum reaction parameters (9 wt% catalyst loading, a 1:16 oleic acid:methanol molar ratio, 85 °C temperature, and 60 min reaction time). Biodiesel was characterized after employing the purification process using a rotary evaporator. NMR and GC analysis was carried out for the biodiesel characterization, as described in “Characterization of biodiesel\"” section. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was carried out in a Jeol instrument having model number ECZ500R/S1 having a frequency ranging from 10 to 535 MHz. The biodiesel sample was dissolved in CDCl3 to perform the NMR analysis. Figure 9a and b portrayed the 1H NMR and 13C spectrum of biodiesel obtained by WNS-SO3H catalyzed esterification of oleic acid. The signal at 0.87 ppm is for the aliphatic –CH3 group present at the end of the chain. The signals at 1.27 and 1.6 ppm are related to aliphatic –CH2 groups away from double bonds and ester groups, while the signal at 2 ppm is for –CH2 groups adjacent to double bonds and 2.27 ppm represents the –CH2 groups (deshielded protons) adjacent to the carbonyl group of the ester. An intense peak at 3.6 ppm (Fig. 9a) reveals the presence of –OCH3 protons which confirms the product formation (biodiesel). Further, the signal at 5.31 ppm reveals the presence of an unsaturated system (–CH=CH–CH=CH–)40,62.Figure 9 NMR spectrum of biodiesel obtained from the esterification of oleic acid with methanol catalyzed by WNS-SO3H using optimum reaction condition (a) 1H NMR spectrum (b) 13C NMR spectrum.

To further elucidate the structural features, we took MCPc as an example. Chemical shifts were assigned (Table 4) according to 1D NMR (1H NMR and 13C NMR) and 2D NMR (COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC, HMBC) spectra (Additional file 1: Figs. S12–S18). 1H NMR spectrum (Additional file 1: Fig. S12) showed that the anomeric region contained four signals at δH 5.33, 5.28, 5.26 and 4.89, which were respectively assigned to →4)-Glcp(1→ (residue A), →3, 4)-Glcp(1→ (residue B), →4, 6)-Glcp(1→ (residue C) and T-Glcp (residue D). As δH 4.89–5.53 ppm was the region of α-anomeric proton [30], combined with the characteristic signals of α-d-glucopyranose in the IR spectra, the residues were considered to have α-configurations. The overlapping signals at the region of H-2 to H-6 (δH 3.2–4.1 ppm) were then assigned according to the 1 H-1 H COSY (Additional file 1: Fig. S14) and TOCSY (Additional file 1: Fig. S15) spectra, combing with ROESY (Additional file 1: Fig. S16), HSQC (Additional file 1: Fig. S17) and HMBC (Additional file 1: Fig. S18) spectra, as well as previous reports [24, 30, 31]. According to the assignment of anomeric protons and HSQC (Additional file 1: Fig. S17) spectrum, the anomeric carbon resonance at 99.8, 99.6 and 98.6 ppm in 13C NMR (Additional file 1: Fig. S13) spectrum was respectively assigned to residue B/C, residue A and residue D. The signals of C-2 to C-6 were then determined mainly based on ROESY (Additional file 1: Fig. S16), HSQC (Additional file 1: Fig. S17) and HMBC (Additional file 1: Fig. S18) spectra. The C-4 signals at around 76.7 ppm of residues A/B/C shifted to a lower field compared with residue D, indicating the existence of O-substituted C-4 of residues A/B/C. Similarly, the lower C-3 signal of residue B and the lower C-6 signal of residue C respectively suggested the presence of substituted groups on C-3 position of residue B and C-6 position of residue C.

The signals of δ 17.69 ppm and δ 94.89 ppm in 13C-NMR spectra were assigned to C-6 and C-2 of Rhap. The signals of δ 1.31 ppm and δ 5.30 ppm were assigned to H-6 and H-2 of Rhap. Taken together, those results indicated the presence of α-1,2-Rhap in SMP-AP (30, 31). The signals δ 170–173.55 ppm were assigned to C-6 of carboxyl signal peaks. This indicated that SMP-AP contains GalpA residues. The chemical shift of H-1 was δ 4.57 ppm, and the chemical shift of C-1 was δ 98.76 ppm. This suggested that the residue is α-D-GalAp. In addition, 13C-NMR results showed that the H-1 proton signals of Ara were mainly concentrated around δ 5.0–5.25 ppm, while the C-1 carbon signals were mainly concentrated around δ 107 − 112 ppm (31–37). According to the literature, the signal at δ 5.14 ppm was assigned to H-1 of α-D-Galp, and the C-1 carbon signal of this residue was at δ 102.01 ppm (38). Figure 5 The 1D NMR spectrum of SMP-NP in D2O (A) 1H NMR spectrum; (B) 13C NMR spectrum.  Based on the above structural analysis of SMP-AP, the main backbone of SMP-AP was α-(1 → 3)-Glcp, which is a typical glucan structure. At the same time, α-(1 → 4)-GalA and α-L-(1 → 4)-Rhap are on the main chain of SMP-AP, which is a typical RG-I pectin structure. In addition, there were Araf and Galp residues on the 2nd position of Rhap as branch chain connections. So, we speculated that there were a few arabinogalactan residues in SMP-AP. We concluded that SMP-AP is an acidic polysaccharide composed of glucan and RG-I pectin that has a small amount of arabingalactan linked to it as branched chains (39). [/INST],\n",

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was filtered over a Buchner filter to remove insoluble byproducts, followed by concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure at room temperature. After concentrating to half of the volume, butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) (2.9 g, 1 wt % relative to BDG) was added to the mixture, and the remaining DCM traces were removed under strong vacuum at room temperature. This resulted in a light yellow, viscous material with a yield of 87%. BDG was protected from light and stored at 4 °C.

Its molecular formula, C24H39NO5, was defined using the HR-ESI-MS spectrum with an ion peak at m/z 444.2725 [M+Na]+ (that calcd for C24H39NO5Na was 444.2726), corresponding to six degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR data of 2 (Table 1) showed characteristic resonances for an olefinic proton at δH 6.79 (H-14), three methines including an oxygenated proton at δH 5.23 (H-6), and five methyls at δH 0.85 (H-17), 0.88 (H-19), 0.94 (H-18), 1.19 (H-20) and 1.98 (H-22). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited 24 carbon signals in total, including two amide/ester carbonyls at δC 170.8 (C-16)/169.9 (C-21), two sp2 carbons at δC 139.5 (C-13)/135.3 (C-14), four methyls at δC 33.4 (C-19)/23.5 (C-18)/21.6 (C-22)/16.0 (C-17), three sp3 methines at δC 69.5 (C-6)/46.7 (C-5)/31.1 (C-8), three sp3 quaternary carbons at δC 75.6 (C-9)/43.4 (C-10)/33.5 (C-4), and nine methylenes. These spectral data indicated that 2 was an analogue of vitexlactam A [13], except for the additional existence of an ethoxy moiety in 2. Further analysis of 2D-NMR spectra of 2 confirmed the assignment above. In the COSY spectrum, the correlation between H2-23 and H2-24 was observable. In the HMBC spectrum, there were long-range correlations from H2-15 to C-23, and from H2-23 to C-15/C-16 (Figure 2), which suggested that the ethoxy moiety was connected to the nitrogen atom. The relative configuration of 2 was determined to be the same as that of vitexlactam A via an observation of NOESY correlations (Figure 3). In the NOESY spectrum, there were cross-peaks between Me-20 and H-8/H2-11/Me-18, indicating they were α-cofacial, while H-5/H-6/Me-19/9-OH were β-cofacial. The absolute configuration of 2 was determined to be 5R/6S/8S/9S/10R via a comparison of its specific rotation [α]25D + 51.7 (c 2.1, MeOH) with that of vitexlactam A [α]25D−10.7 (c 0.42, CHCl3) [13], showing an opposite sign. Furthermore, a comparison of the calculated optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) spectrum of 2 tothe experimental one also supported that assignment, in which the calculated ORD spectrum of 5R,6S,8S,9S,10R of 2 agreed well with the experimental curve for 2 (Figure 6). Thus, 2 was elucidated as shown in Figure 1, and named zeylleucapenoid B. [/INST],\n",

It was synthesized by the Passerini three-component reaction of Ad-NC, CHO-Br, and methacrylic acid, providing the polymer branched chains with bromo groups to initiate the polymerization and adamantyl groups for molecular recognition. According to a previous report, Ad-NC was synthesized directly from adamantanol in one step. The synthesis of Ad-NC was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The 13C NMR spectrum of Ad-NC exhibits a peak at 150.66 ppm, belonging to the isocyanine group. CHO-Br was obtained by the esterification reaction of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide. The 1H NMR spectrum of CHO-Br is shown in Figure S2. The synthesized ABMA was obtained in high yield (70.1%), and due to the high reactivity of the isocyanate, the reaction conditions were mild. As shown in the 1H NMR spectrum of ABMA (Figure S3, Supporting Information), the characteristic peaks of products of the Passerini reaction appear at 5.74 and 5.95 ppm, corresponding to the protons of the newly formed tertiary carbon atom and the amide group, respectively. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S3), the peak at 74.03 ppm can be observed for the newly formed tertiary carbon atom. The NMR spectrum results can prove the successful preparation of monomer ABMA.

We suggest that this is due to the structural complexity of DAPTES including asymmetric carbon atoms and bulky groups, which result in the possible coexistence of at least two isomers in the solution. The 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES was compared to that of SAPTES. The assignment of the signals for the two compounds is provided in the Materials and Methods section. A multiplet between 4.50 ppm and 4.23 ppm is seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES as proof of the formation of the -HNCH(Fur)P(O)- motif. The signal for the hydrogen from the imine -N=CH-group in SAPTES appears at 8.00 ppm, i.e., in the spectral region of the protons of DOPO. Therefore, it is not straightforward to conclude that this signal disappeared in the DAPTES spectrum due to its possible overlap with the DOPO resonances. However, it is clearly seen that the signal for the carbon atom from the imine group at about 152 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of SAPTES disappeared, and a doublet at 55.95 ppm with a coupling constant 1J{PC} = 115.17 Hz appeared in the 13C NMR spectrum of DAPTES (Figure S2) due to the newly formed aminophosphonate structure (–HNCH(Fur)P(O)–). Further evidence for the completion of the addition reaction is found in the comparison of the 1H and 31P{H} NMR spectra of DOPO and that of DAPTES. The doublet at 8.07 ppm (1J{PH} = 594 Hz) due to the P-H bond in the 1H NMR spectrum of DOPO (Figure S3) did not register in the 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES as a consequence of the addition of the P-H bond from DOPO to the imine function of SAPTES. Secondly, the signal for the phosphorus atom in DOPO shifted downfield by 14 ppm in the 31P{H} NMR spectrum of DAPTES, as seen in Figure 1. Additionally, the DEPT-135 experiment (Figure S4) was performed, and the 2D 1H-1H COSY (Figure S5), 1H-13C HSQC (Figure S6), and 1H-13C HMBC (Figure S7) spectra of DAPTES were registered to further confirm that the product presents one substance (one and the same composition and atoms connectivity), i.e., the complexity of the spectra is due to conformational isomers.

The mixture was refluxed with magnetic stirring for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere and then overnight at room temperature. The solution was recovered by filtration and concentrated by evaporation under a vacuum. The resulting oil was dissolved in dry ethanol (50 mL) and stirred with NaBH4 (0.246 g, 6.51 mmol) at 333 K for 2 h and at room temperature for 6 h. The resultant was concentrated by evaporation, dissolved in CH2Cl2, and washed with an aqueous NaOH solution (2 mol/L, 30 mL × 4). The organic layers were collected and dried over Na2SO4. After solvent removal under vacuum, a yellow oil was obtained. The product was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and HCl (37%) was dropwise added to the resulting solution, affording the triammonium chloride salt of L2 (L2·3HCl) as a yellow solid. Yield 789 mg (80%).

To modify PMPC as a biocompatible polymer on TiO2 nanoparticles, a new water-soluble dithiobenzoate-based RAFT agent possessing a phosphonic acid group (RAFT-PO4H2) was synthesized, where the phosphonic acid group can form a stable linkage with TiO2 nanoparticles. 4-Cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid N-succinimidyl ester was reacted with O-phosphoryl ethanolamine in a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide/water. The product was purified via inverse silica gel chromatography. The purification of the target RAFT agent was confirmed by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy (see in Figure 1 and Supplementary Materials Figure S1). From ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectral measurements, RAFT-PO4H2 has a maximum absorbance wavelength of 305 nm with a small peak at 480 nm (see in Supplementary Materials Figure S2), indicating that RAFT-PO4H2 has a phenylcarbonothioylthio group. RAFT-COOH has a low solubility in water (even under basic conditions); however, RAFT-PO4H2 is easily dissolved in water. The high water solubility of RAFT-PO4H2 may be attributed to its phosphonic acid and amide groups. [/INST],\n",

Furthermore, the corresponding CH2(b) and CH3(d) signals at the higher field (−0.96 to 0.01 ppm) due to the weaker shielding effect, reflecting that the bowl is flatter than its sulfur analog.  Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were conducted to determine the thermal stability of both compounds. The results showed that the onset decomposition temperatures of both 1a and 1b are above 400 °C (Supplementary Fig. 24), reflecting their thermal robustness. Meanwhile, these trichalcogenasupersumanenes are stable enough and can be stored in solution and solid under air atmosphere for weeks without any change. [/INST],\n",

The aromatic region of the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 (Figure S3) showed a 3H ABX system at δ 7.04 (d 2.0 Hz, H2), δ 6.99 (dd 8.2, 2.0 Hz, H6) and δ 6.75 (d 8.2 Hz, H5), a 2H AX system at δ 7.48 (d 15.9 Hz, H7) and δ 6.24 (d 15.9 Hz, H8), as well as to two phenolic hydroxyl protons at δ 9.59 (4-OH) and δ 9.13 (3-OH), in accordance with a caffeoyl moiety. This identification was confirmed by the observation of nine 13C signals assigned to this unit by the 2D 1H-13C HMBC spectrum and the 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of compound 2 (Table 1, Figures S4 and S5). The large coupling constant of 15.9 Hz observed for H7 and H8 confirmed the (E)-configuration of the double bond of the caffeoyl moiety. The crosspeaks at δ 4.11/166.4 (H1A’/C9) and δ 4.08/166.4 (H1B’/C9) revealed that the carboxyl of compound 2 was esterified with the γ-hydroxyl of a highly hydroxylated organic acid containing four carbons, which was identified as the methyl ester of threonic acid. A comparison between the relatively weak CD spectrum of compound 2 to that of commercially available L-threonic acid provided by Sigma Aldrich (Figure S16) revealed that both molecules exhibited a positive band around 195 nm and a negative band around 220 nm, indicating that the methyl threonyl moiety of compound 2 shares the same stereochemistry as that of L-threonic acid, which is synonymous with (2R,3S)-2,3,4-trihydroxybutanoic acid. Thus, compound 2 was identified as 4-Oxy-(E)-Caffeoyl-2′R,3′S-2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acid methyl ester (Figure 2). Moreover, the sample of compound 2 also contained a minor component, namely compund 3. The 1H and 13C signals belonging to compound 3 shared many similarities with that of compound 2, indicating that compound 3 is a structural isomer of compound 2, i.e., a caffeoyl derivative esterified with threonic acid (Table 1). The coupling constant observed between H7 and H8 (12.9 Hz) confirmed the identity of compound 3 to be 4-Oxy-(Z)-Caffeoyl-2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acid methyl ester (Figure 2). Very recently, Cao et al. identified 4-Oxy-(E)-Caffeoyl-2′R,3′R-2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acid methyl ester as a novel natural product from the flower buds of Magnolia biondii pamp [16]. The UV and the 1H and 13C NMR data of compound 2 are in good agreement with the NMR data reported for the similar compound by Cao et al. (2021), with only relatively minor differences of chemical shift values due to solvent differences because the NMR data of Cao et al. were recorded in a different solvent (CD3OD) [16]. [/INST],\n",

Later, under vigorous stirring, a solution of sulfuric acid (1.5 mL) was added dropwise, immediately turning into a dark purple color. The reaction was followed by TLC using as eluent hexane:ethyl acetate (7:3) until the complete consumption of the starting material (~24h). The final reaction mixture had a dark blue/purple color. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the reaction mixture was dried under vacuum. Afterwards, the crude was purified by RP18 column chromatography starting with HCl 0,1 M:MeOH 75:25 as eluent and gradually changing its polarity until 100% methanol. The collected fractions were analyzed by HPLC to identify the product fractions (following absorption at 670 nm), and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Finally, 170 mg of 1 were obtained as a dark blue oil (η= 62.54%), which was further washed with ether and centrifugated to obtain a dark blue precipitate. 1H NMR (400 MHz, MeOD) δ (ppm): 8.31 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 8.06 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.65 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 7.57 (s, 1H), 7.50 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 2H), 7.36 (d, J = 9.4 Hz, 1H), 7.23 (q, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 6.93 (d, J = 9.4 Hz, 1H), 6.79 (s, 1H), 3.82 (s, 4H), 3.61 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 3.24 (q, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H), 2.77 (s, 3H), 2.43 (q, J = 5.5 Hz, 6H), 1.43 (q, J = 5.8 Hz, 2H), 0.82 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, MeOD) δ (ppm): 163.04, 160.73, 158.23, 153.38, 149.84, 148.64, 143.01, 142.53, 137.83, 134.97, 133.94, 133.51, 131.35, 129.12, 127.86, 125.33, 122.14, 121.64, 97.00, 66.91, 56.69, 55.58, 50.84, 47.48, 46.82, 28.36, 28.17, 22.71, 12.97 (all collected spectra and peaks assignments are found in the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S5 and Table S1).

The purity of the compound was elucidated by HPLC and was found to be 99.5% [35]. The 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectrum recorded in DMSO d-6 showed five methyl groups at δH 0.74 (3H, s, H-18), 0.89 (3H, s, H-19), 1.22 (3H, s, H-21 and 3H, s, H-26) and 1.25 (3H, s, H-27), as well as a set of methylene group signals between δ H1.00 to δH 2.00, the ethylenic proton H-7 at δH 5.82 (1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz) and 3 CH-OH (δH 3.8), typical of the 20-HE skeleton. This was further confirmed by the 13C NMR spectrum which showed three O-bonded quaternary carbons (δC 71.3; 77.9; 85.2) and the presence of α, β-unsaturated ketone (δC 122.1; 168.0; 206.5) (Table 1) [36]. Finally, using the ESI-MS in positive mode showed a peak at m/z 481.243 corresponding to a [M+H]+ molecular ion. A molecular formula of C27H44O7 related to 20-HE was then deduced and confirmed according to the literature [36,37,38,39].

Claisen–Schmidt condensation of compound acetyl compound 1 with the mole equivalents of substituted aldehydes 2 in the presence of potassium hydroxide solution at room temperature affords of the corresponding chalcone derivatives 3–10 (Scheme 1). The constitution of the formed chalcones was proved by careful inspection of the different spectral tools. 1H NMR spectra of chalcone derivative number 6 as a representative example indicated two characteristic singlet signals at 3.48 and 3.72 ppm for two methoxy groups. The isoquinoline-H5 and H6 groups appeared as multiplets at 2.64, 3.71, and 4.23 ppm. The –OCH2O– group appeared as a singlet at 6.01 ppm. The isoquinoline H10b, H7, and H10 appeared as three singlets at 6.01, 6.61, and 6.87 ppm. Besides, it revealed the vinyl and aromatic protons as multiplets at δ 6.96–7.56 ppm. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectra of compound 6 indicated 26 different types of carbon signals appeared at their expected positions.Scheme 1 Synthesis of novel tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-a]isoquinoline chalcones 3–10 [/INST],\n",

The 1H NMR spectrum and 13C NMR and HSQC spectra showed the resonances of 18 carbons, which were classified into eight aromatic quaternary carbons, one carbonyl carbon, four sp3 methylene carbons, one sp3 methine carbon, two methyl carbons, and two methoxy carbons (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 2–5). 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy indicated the presence of one spin-coupling system, H-1′/H-2′/H-3′/H-4′/H-5′/H-6′(H-7′), as shown in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the HMBC cross-peaks from O-Me-13 to C5, from O-Me-14 to C6, from NH to C2 and from OH-4 to C2/4/5 (Supplementary Fig. 6), revealed the presence of a 4-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-pyridinecarboxamide moiety. Cross-peaks from H-9 to C-7/8/11 were observed in the HMBC spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting a 4-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-7-thiazolyl-picolinamide moiety. Lastly, the 4-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-7-thiazolyl-pyridinecarboxamide moiety and the alkyl chain were found to be attached at the C11 position, based on the key HMBC correlation from H-1′ to C11/C-9/C-8 (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy that the assignment of compound 1 was confounded by the lack of clear HMBC correlations, largely due to the high fraction of quaternary carbons and heteroatoms. Fortunately, however, the crystal structure of the also isolated compound 7 enabled unambiguous structural confirmation of the karnamicins by analogy (Fig. 1b). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of co-isolated 2–6 also showed high similarity to those of 1 and 7, except for alkyl side chain substitutions (Fig. 1b). Their structures were then determined based on extensive analyses of spectroscopic data (Supplementary Tables 2–6 and Supplementary Figs. 7–37).

These test results are within a reasonable range, suggesting the sample was pure (Fig 3A and 3B). As shown in the 1H-NMR spectrum, H1-4 is the characteristic hydrogen of ABZ, and H5-11 is the characteristic hydrogen of BA. The above can be found in the 1H spectrum of the sample. At the same time, the ratio of 11:2:3 is about 1:1:1, indicating that ABZ and BA are linked in a 1:1 ratio (Fig 3C). The feature C of linkers C1, 16, 17 was identified by 13C-NMR spectrum analysis; and the ABZ feature C-linker C2, 7, 8, 14 along with BA C-linker C9-17 could also be found in the spectrum. Therefore, ABZ-BA linkage was demonstrated, with the expected ABZ and BA fragments and C1,16 linker ester and amide bonds (Fig 3D).  According to WHO treatment guidelines, patients with alveolar echinococcosis must take ABZ orally for extended periods, but the strong crystallization trend of ABZ leads to low solubility and poor oral bioavailability, which seriously limits its clinical application. We previously confirmed that the expression of ASBT in the ileum of a rat model with alveolar echinococcosis is significantly higher than that of normal rats. Therefore, a new formulation ABZ (ABZ-BA) chemically linked to bile acids, the ligand of ASBT, should greatly improve drug oral absorption. [/INST],\n",

Then, 20 mL (6 M) degassed NaNO2 aqueous solution was added into the reaction system under nitrogen protection27. After stirring 30 min, 20 mL (6 M) HCl aqueous solution was added dropwise through a constant pressure dropping funnel27. The reaction solution gradually changed from red to orange and finally obtained a pale-yellow precipitate. After stirring for 4 h, the solid precipitate was collected by centrifugation (1800 × g, 10 min)27. The collected solid product was washed by pure water and mixed solution of 50% (v/v) ethanol and water in turn 10 times to remove residual reactants, and dried under vacuum drying overnight27. All operations are in a dark environment27. The structure of synthesized BNN6 was confirmed by a fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-MS, solariX, Bruker, Germany) and 1H NMR spectroscopy and 1C NMR spectroscopy (600 MHz, Bruker AV-600, Germany). solariX was utilized to determine the molecular weight of synthetic BNN6.

Figure 4g displays the 1H-NMR spectra of Ptriaz-CN and the Ptriaz-CN/metal ion complex in a H2O/DMSO-d6 mixture (v/v = 1:5) solvent. The proton signals of C3 and C5 in the 1,2,4-triazolium ring were clearly observed at 9.2 and 10.4 ppm, respectively. Upon the addition of Au3+, the C5-proton signal in the 1,2,4-triazolium ring disappeared, indicative of its reductive and coordinative interplay with Au3+. Moreover, in the 13C-NMR spectra of Fig. 4h, the representative resonance of the C-Au bond was detected at 174 ppm, supporting that the C5/carbene site has a strong coordination effect with gold45. For the 1H-NMR spectra of the Ptriaz-CN/(Pt2+ and Cu2+) complex solutions, the C5-proton signals in the 1,2,4-triazolium ring shifted slightly from 10.4 ppm to 10.6 ppm and 10.1 ppm, indicating H···Pt2+ and H···Cu2+ interactions, respectively, instead of reductive coordination. Importantly, metal-carbene peaks were not observed in the 13C-NMR spectra for both Ptriaz-CN/(Pt2+ and Cu2+) complex solutions (Fig. S26). These results prove that metal ions other than Au3+ interacted with the C5-proton as a dynamic Lewis acid-base pair so that the C5-proton could not be eliminated to generate the carbene site for coordination with metal ions to form metal-carbene bonds.

The 1H signals of compound 2 revealed the presence of two methyl proton signals [δ H 1.20 (3H, t, J = 7.1 Hz), δ H 1.44 (3H, d, J = 6.3 Hz)], five methylene proton signals [δ H 1.53 (1H, dt, J = 13.2, 3.5 Hz), δ H 0.80 (1H, q, J = 12.0 Hz), δ H 2.30 (1H, m), δ H 1.96 (1H, m), δ H 3.29 (1H, td, J = 8.8, 2.7 Hz), δ H 2.40 (1H, m), δ H 3.39 (1H, dd, J = 12.0, 2.0 Hz), δ H 2.41 (1H, m), δ H 4.08 (2H, q, J = 7.1 Hz)], four methine proton signals [δ H 1.63 (1H, m), δ H 2.43 (1H, m), δ H 2.47 (1H, m), δ H 4.37 (1H, m)], two aromatic proton signals [δ H 6.63 (1H, s), δ H 6.98 (1H, s)], a double bond proton signal δ H 7.46 (1H, s), and two methoxy proton signals [δ H 3.79 (3H, s), δ H 3.84 (3H, s)]. The 13C NMR signals of compound 2 revealed the presence of an indole moiety (δ C 97.2, 111.3, 126.1, 136.3, 146.0, 151.0), an ester carbonyl carbon signal (δ C 168.9), a carbonyl carbon signal (δ C 183.4), two double bond carbon signals (δ C 111.4, 156.3), two methyl carbon signals (δc 14.6, 18.8), five methylene carbon signals (δ C 31.3, 35.0, 54.4, 54.9, 60.7), four methine carbon signals (δc 31.9, 39.4, 72.6, 73.7), a tertiary carbon signal (δc 58.8), and two methoxy carbon signals (δc 56.8, 57.6). The NMR data (Table S1) indicated that the structure of compound 2 is similar to that of compound carapanaubine. The main difference between these two compounds in NMR spectra was that one methylene carbon (δ C 60.7) was observed in the compound 2 (Reina et al., 2011). Combined with the significant HMBC correlations between H-23 and C-22, 24, a C-23 methylene group was established. From the evidence accumulated above, the structure of compound 2 was established (Figure 7) and was named Rauvolf B. [/INST],\n",

The 13C NMR spectrum revealed 17 carbon resonances that consisted of a -COO- fragment signal (δ 172.2), a -O-CH2- fragment signal (δ 67.6), a -O-CH3 fragment signal (δ 55.3), six aromatic carbon signals (δ 105.5, 165.7, 98.8, 163.8, 111.1, and 143.0) and eight aliphatic carbon signals (δ 38.8, 30.6, 29.0, 24.6, 24.0, 23.0, 14.0, and 11.1). The DEPT spectra (Supplementary Figure S27) demonstrated five methylene signals: δ 67.6, 30.6, 29.0, 24.0, and 23.0. The HSQCs (Supplementary Figure S24) indicated directly linked hydrocarbon correlations. According to the HMBCs (Figure 2; Supplementary Figure S25), correlations from δ H (0.94) to δ C (24.0/38.8), δ H (0.90) to δ C (23.0/29.0), δ H (1.32) to δ C (14.0/23.0/29.0/30.6), and δ H (1.39) to δ C (23.0/29.0) showed the presence of -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 fragment in the aliphatic chain, and δ H (0.94) to δ H (1.45) showed -CH2-CH3. The correlations from δ H (1.38) to δ C (38.0/67.6), δ H (1.45) to δ C (67.6/38.8/11.1/30.6), δ H (1.71) to δ C (67.6/24.0/11.1/30.6), and δ H (4.27) to δ C (23.0/30.6/38.8/172.7) together indicated the fragment of CH3-CH2-CH-CH2-OOC-, in which -CH- was linked to the butyl group. The δ H (2.51)–δ C (143.0/111.1/105.5) and δ H (3.80)–δ C (163.8) revealed that the methyl and oxymethyl existed on the benzene ring. At the same time combined with COSY correlations (Supplementary Figure S23), the planar structure of compound 3 was shown in Figure 2. The main hydrogen-related signals shown by the NOESY spectra (Figure 2; Supplementary Figure S26) were δ H (4.27)–δ H (0.94/1.32/1.39/1.45/1.71), δ H (2.51)–δ H (1.32/1.39/1.45/1.71), δ H (6.33)–δ H (3.80), and δ H (6.28)–δ H (2.52). In addition, the CD spectrum (Supplementary Figure S18) of compound 3 was compared with the related literature previously published (Nahrstedt et al., 1990). Compound 3 presented one negative which was consistent with (S)-2-Methylbutan-1-yl-β-D-glucopyranoside, indicating that the absolute configuration of C-10 was S. Through SciFinder database query, it was confirmed that compound 3 was a new compound and shared the similar structure with 2-ethylhexyl orsellinate (Bui et al., 2020), named 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxy orsellinate.

The molecular formula C18H15O6 was evidenced by LC-MS (ESI+), which exhibited molecular ion peaks at m/z m/z 345 [M + H]+. The 1H N.M.R. spectrum revealed the presence of two aromatic systems, each bearing a set of m-coupling protons (δH 6.29, 6.24, 6.20, 6.18, J = 2.2 Hz). One oxymethine multiplet (δ 4.72), protons of two methylene groups (δH 3.06/2.95 (J = 13.7, 7.4 Hz); δH 2.84/2.80 (J = 16.4, 10.4 Hz)) were confirmed by COSY to construct a 2-oxypropandiyl partial structure. The 13C-NMR/HMQC spectra delivered 18 carbon signals, two for ketone (δc 206.7) and ester carbonyls (δC 171.3). Based on HSQC/HMBC correlations, the oxymethine proton (δH 4.72) showed a cross signal with the carbon at C10 (δC 139.4) of the phenyl ring, confirming their linkage via CH2-9 (δC 39.6; δH 3.06, 2.95); hence, basic skeleton was confirmed. The phenyl ring was confirmed to bear an acetyl group at C-2′, while the residual two positions of C-3′ (δ 160.2) and C-5′ (δC 161.4) were established as phenolic carbons.

This crude extract contained six compounds, including B and another highly cytotoxic compound, D. In our study, we compared the effect of our isolated compound on CRC cells with that of the crude extract, EL000327. Initiation of apoptosis upon treatment with EL000327 was detected by Hoechst staining, the incucyte apoptosis assay, and flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis. However, apoptotic markers were not clearly detected by western blot analysis at the same time points as B. Induction of cell cycle arrest, activation of autophagy, or the ROS/JNK pathway related proteins in Caco2 cells were also not observed upon treatment with EL000327. These results suggest that interactions between different compounds in the crude extract may alter the activity of EL000327. Alternatively, the effects of EL000327 and B may have been detected at different time points because EL000327 was either faster or slower to act than B.  5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a first-line treatment for many cancers, including CRC. 5-FU leads cells to death by preventing DNA replication and RNA synthesis through inhibition of cellular thymidylate synthase (TS) [46,47]. Combination treatments in which 5-FU is combined with different anticancer agents, enhance the anticancer effect and response rate of these treatments. Similarly, combination of B with 5-FU enhanced the cytotoxicity of B toward Caco2 and HCT116 cells at significantly lower treatment concentrations [48,49]. Combination of B and 5-FU induced apoptosis in Caco2 cells by enhancing the expression of cleaved caspase-3and PARP. Further investigations are required to understand the mechanism by which cytotoxicity is increased in the synergy between B and 5-FU. Furthermore, B exhibited excellent synergic effects with compound D. A combination of B and D induced apoptosis and autophagy in the Caco2 cells at comparatively low concentrations. These results provide evidence that B may act synergistically with a range of different anticancer agents to enhance their cytotoxic effect.  B is a novel naturally-derived compound, and this is the first study of the activity of B on CRC cells. We thoroughly investigated the mechanisms by which B induces apoptotic cell death and have laid the groundwork for a detailed analysis of the clinical usefulness of B. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the combination of B with known and novel anticancer agents may provide effective new treatment options for patients with CRC, which warrants further investigation.  5. Conclusions  The results of this study demonstrate that B induced caspase dependent apoptosis and autophagy in Caco2 cells via activating the ROS/JNK signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, B stabilized the microtubule dynamics and disrupted cell cycle progression by inducing G2/M phase arrest. Moreover, B exhibited synergism with known chemotherapeutic 5FU and novel compound D on the CRC cells. Together, B shows great potential as a novel drug candidate that can be used for further research to develop into an anticancer therapeutic against CRC.

EI mass spectra of 58 exhibited a base peak at m/z 107 and a signal at m/z 222, which could be attributed to the molecular ion. ESI (+)-HRMS measurements confirms the molecular formula C15H26O, (detected ion C15H26ONa+ (m/z)exp 245.1879 and (m/z)th 245.1876, error +1.2 ppm). The formula indicated a saturation degree of 3. The 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 300 K) spectrum of 58 (Table 2, Figure S1) showed the presence of five methyl groups δ 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 (s, H13, H15, H12 and H14, respectively) and δ 0.9 (t, J = 7.44 Hz, H1) and four olefinic protons δ 5.1 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, H10), δ 5.6 (d, J =15.3 Hz, H4), δ 5.9 (d, J = 10.8 Hz, H6) and δ 6.5 (dd, J = 15.3, 10.8 Hz, H5). The 13C-NMR spectrum contained 15 resonances (Figure S2): five methyls, three methylenes, four methines and three quaternary carbons. The occurrence of a quaternary carbon at 73.38 ppm suggested the presence of a tertiary alcohol. Spectral data were similar to those of nerolidol, which suggests a farnesane-type compound. The HSQC and HMBC correlations (Figure 2A, Figures S3 and S4) and NOE correlations (Figure 2B and Figure S5) indicated that the oxygenated carbon (C3) was correlated with the methyl (C13), the methylene group (C2) and the methine (C4). The signal between 5.5 and 6.6 ppm of 1H-NMR spectrum showed coupling of methine protons (H4, H5 and H6) (Figure 3). This correlation indicated the presence of a conjugated ethylenic system. The signal of H5 is observed as a doublet of doublets pattern due to its interaction with H6 and H4; the corresponding 3J coupling constant values are 10.8 and 15.3 Hz, respectively. The coupling constant 3JH5,H6, indicated the E-configuration of the diene fragment [23]. In addition, the coupling constant 3JH4,H5 (15.6 Hz) corresponds to an E-configuration of the C4-C5 double bond, confirmed by NOE correlation among H5 and H13. The configuration of the C6-C7 double bond was established from NOE correlation between H6 → H8 and H5 → H14, respectively, suggesting an E configuration. Finally, the structure of compound 58 was determined as 1,2-dihydro-4,5-dehydronerolidol. [/INST],\n",

The structure of product 6 was proved by spectral (IR, mass, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) and elemental data. The 1H-NMR spectrum of product 6a showed a singlet signal at δ = 10.36 ppm assigned to the -NH proton, in addition to the usual signals of the fourteen aromatic protons and the two CH3 group protons. Furthermore, the IR spectrum showed two stretching bands at υ = 1725 and 3347 cm−1 due to the C=O and the NH groups. Its 13C-NMR spectrum showed δ = 8.4, 14.7 (2CH3), 116.3–162.1 (20Ar-C and C=N) and 163.5 (C=O) ppm. Moreover, the mass spectra of all derivatives of compound 6 showed molecular ion peaks at the right molecular weight for the corresponding molecules (see the Section 3 experimental section, supporting information).

The first two steps, similar to those described in order to obtain ethers 3 and 5, made it possible to obtain intermediate products 8 and 9 with yields of 70% and 67%, respectively. For the third step, the bromination of alcohol 9 to generate 10, it was not possible to use the classical Appel bromination conditions (triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and CBr4 in dichloromethane) because they lead to the transformation of the carboxamide group of 9 to the corresponding nitrile 8. To avoid this unwanted reaction, we alternatively used a method initially developed by Chen et al. [34] using PPh3, tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and dibromoethane. Under the conditions deemed optimal for the bromination of a primary alcohol in the presence of a m-carbamoyl phenyl group [35], compound 10 was however obtained with a low yield of 26%. An incomplete reaction and a difficult purification by silica gel chromatography explain this low yield. The formation of the desired compound 10 was confirmed by the signal at 3.45 ppm (CH2Br) in 1H NMR while the signal at 34.2 ppm in 13C NMR is in agreement with the literature data for a CH2Br on an alkyl chain [26,27]. The two peaks of the same intensity appearing on the mass spectrum are also characteristic of the presence of a bromine atom and of the substitution of the primary alcohol.  3.2.

The sequences are annotated as BBE-like enzymes based on sequence homology. P93479 from Papaver somniferum was also detected at the transcript level and is proposed to be involved in the formation of (S)-scoulerine via the oxidative cyclization of the N-methyl moiety of (S)-reticuline [12]. The orthologs share about 35–40% sequence identity to Q8GTB6.  The three orthologues were expressed in P. pastoris according to previous work on the expression of Q8GTB6 using the same host [13,14]. The purified enzymes were used to determine the kinetic parameters of cannabinoid synthase activity using CBGA (1) as substrate (Table 2). When compared to the THCA synthase Q8GTB6 also expressed in P. pastoris [13,14], the orthologues are approximately 10-fold slower.  2.3.

At the excitation wavelength of 380 nm, the donor (imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine) transfers energy to the acceptor (benzopyran) and NIR fluorescence emission at 760 nm was observed. However, after the addition of SO32−, the reaction between SO32− and benzopyran breaks the π conjugate of benzopyran, resulting in the destruction of FRET, and thus, the energy of imidazo[1,5-a] pyridine cannot be transferred to the benzopyran. Therefore, the fluorescence emission at 760 nm disappeared and the emission at 475 nm increased. This is also confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure S5).  3. Experimental  Synthesis of the Probe IPB-RL-1  As demonstrated in Scheme 1, compounds 1–4 were synthesized according to the reported procedure [9,27].  Compound 3 (0.10 g, 0.24 mmol), compound 4 (0.10 g, 0.28 mmol) and CH3COOH (8 mL) were added to a 25 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was heated to reflux for 3 h and then poured into water (100 mL). After being extracted with DCM (20 mL) three times, the combined organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The pure product was obtained by column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH = 200:1).

Conclusions  In summary, a NIR ratiometric fluorescent probe IPB-RL-1 with an ultra-large Stokes shift (460 nm) that is superior to most reported probes has been developed. IPB-RL-1 shows high sensitivity and selectivity. Detection of SO2 in mitochondria in living SKOV-3 cells was also realized. Moreover, the probe was successfully used to detect SO2 in zebrafish which may be useful for the understanding of biological roles of SO2 in mitochondria and in vivo. However, due to the small overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption of the probe IPB-RL-1, the fluorescence transfer efficiency is only 51%, which implies that in order to obtain a high fluorescence transfer efficiency, the overlap effect between donor emission and acceptor absorption, in addition to the distance between donor and acceptor, should be carefully considered for the FRET-based probe design in the future.

Specifically, the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited 27 signals, which were assigned to three aromatic rings, one ester group (167.8 ppm), two hydroxymethylenes (72.5 and 64.6 ppm), one hydroxymethine (85.4 ppm), two methines (50.5 and 44.3 ppm), one methylene 34.3), and two methoxy groups (56.3 and 56.4). This obtained profile suggested the presence of a lignan derivative [19]. On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of 11 aromatic protons attributable to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic rings and one benzoic acid. Homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (H-1H COSY) and 1D Total Correlation Spectroscopy (1D-TOCSY) experiments showed correlations between H-2/H-6, H-2′/H-6′, H-2″/H-6″, H-7/H-9′, H-7/H-7′. The connectivity of each proton to the respective carbon was confirmed in the heteronuclear-single-quantum-coherence (HSQC) spectrum, while 13C NMR data assignments (Table 1) were made, using a heteronuclear-multiple-bond-correlation (HMBC) experiment. The HMBC correlations between the signal of H-2″, H-6″, and H-9′ and the signal at 167.8 ppm (C-7″) indicated benzoic acid esterification at C-9′. Analysis of the 2D NMR spectra, especially the HMBC data, confirmed that 1 was a lignan with a similar structure to agastinol [19], with the only difference being the presence of benzoic acid which was esterified at C-9′ in 1 instead of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in agastinol. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 1 was determined as 4-benzoic acid 4-(4-hydroxy-3-meethoxybenzyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) tetrahydrofuran-3-ylmethyl ester, a new natural lignan named rhanteriol (Figures S1–S6).

Production of SAG by B. amyloliquefaciens FJ18 in a nonaqueous phase has been previously described [18]. B. licheniformis WNJ02 (CCTCC NO:M2018394) was adaptively domesticated by B. amyloliquefaciens FJ18. WNJ02 was glycosylated with the 7-phenolic hydroxyl group of apigenin to form apigenin-7-O-β-(6″-O)-d-glucoside, and the 6-hydroxyl group of the glucose group in AG was succinylated to form SAG. The conversion rate of apigenin to SAG by WNJ02 was 94.2%. The reaction schema is shown in Figure 1a. High-resolution ESI-MS of the SAG product (Figure S1) detected a molecular ion [M+H] + with a mass of 533.13, with apigenin at m/z 271.06, presumably linking a glucose and a succinyl group at different sites to obtain m/z 533.13 and m/z 534.13, indicating an empirical formula of C25H24O13. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR results are shown in Table 1, Figure 1b, Figures S2 and S3, which show the characteristics of a glucose group and a succinyl group. HMBC (Figure S4) confirmed that the hydroxy group at O-6″ of the glycosyl group was succinylated to form apigenin-7-O-β-(6″-O-succinyl)-d-glucoside, namely SAG. Our group successfully developed the first biological method to form succinylated derivatives.  2.2. Molecular Docking [/INST],\n",

Zirconium (IV) acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4) (Sigma Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a copolymerization initiator. The synthesis was carried out in bulk in a Teflon reactor under the argon at 130 °C for 24 h and for the next 72 h at 115 °C. The molar ratio of the initiator to the sum of moles of monomers was 1:3000. Detailed procedure for obtaining PLGA via ROP was described by Dobrzynski et al. [10]. The real composition of copolymer was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. The molar ratio of lactidyl to glycolidyl units in the obtained copolymer was 85:15 mol% and the monomer conversion was 96%.

To a stirred solution of methyl vinyl ketone (2.5 equiv, 7.18 mmol. 0.61 mL) in pentane (6.0 mL) was drop-wisely added a solution of bromine (2.6 equiv, 7.46 mmol, 0.30 mL) in pentane (3.0 mL) at −15 °C. The reaction was continuously stirred for 10 min. After that, all volatile substances were removed under reduced pressure to provide the crude 1,2-dibromobutan-2-one. Next, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone or lawsone (1 equiv, 2.87 mmol, 500 mg) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 15 mL). The reaction mixture was added 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU, 3.7 equiv, 10.62 mmol, 1.60 mL), resulting in the red solution. The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 20 min under the nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the solution of crude 1,2-dibromobutane in dry THF (3 mL) was added. After addition, the reaction mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature for 30 min, followed by refluxing for 5 h. To the reaction was added another portion of DBU (0.52 equiv, 1.49 mmol, 0.22 mL) and was continuously refluxed for the additional 3 h. The reaction was quenched with a saturated ammonium chloride-water solution and extracted with chloroform (25 mL, 3 times). The organic layers were combined, washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (NaSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a crude product.

The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer. The yellow precipitate obtained was filtered off and washed with water followed by petroleum ether and dried under vacuum. The completion of the reaction was monitored on pre-coated silica gel plates by the thin layer chromatography (TLC) method using chloroform and methanol as the solvent system in the ratio (9:1).

For C39H54O5Na+, 625.3863). The IR absorption bands revealed the presence of carbonyls (1690 and 1605 cm−1). The 1H NMR data (Table 1) exhibited signals indicative of seven methyl singlets [δH 1.16 (3H, s), 1.10 (3H, s), 1.04 (3H, s), 0.99 (6H, s), 0.97 (3H, s), and 0.82 (3H, s)], one trisubstituted double bond proton [δH 5.33 (1H, s)], a trans-coumaroyl moiety [δH 8.07 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz), 7.69 (2H, d, J = 8.2 Hz), 7.20 (2H, m), and 6.74 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz)] [18], an oxymethine proton [δH 4.90 (1H, dd, J = 11.6, 4.7 Hz)], along with a series of aliphatic multiples. The 13C NMR and DEPT135 spectra showed 39 carbon resonances indicative of a trans-coumaroyl group (δC 167.7, 161.8, 145.4, 131.1 × 2, 126.6, 117.3 × 2, and 116.2), one carboxylic carbon (δC 179.4), one trisubstituted double bonds (δC 139.3 and 132.5), ten sp3 methylenes, four sp3 methines (one oxygenated), seven methyls, and six sp3 quaternary carbons. The abovementioned information revealed an oleanane core, morolic acid [19], with a trans-coumaroyl substituent, which was further validated by elucidation of 2D NMR analyses of 1 (Figure 2). In particular, the HMBC cross-peak from H-3 [δH 4.90 (dd, J = 11.6, 4.7 Hz)] of the oleanane core to the ester carbonyl (C-1′, δC 167.7) of the coumaroyl moiety located this group at OH-3. The relative configuration of 1, regarding the oleanane part, was established via interpretation of NOESY data (Figure 3) and by comparing its NMR date with those of morolic acid. As shown in Figure 3, the strong NOE interactions of H-3/H-5 and Me-24/Me-25 disclosed that these methyls or protons were axially oriented on the chair conformational A-ring. Me-24 and Me-25 were arbitrarily assigned β-orientations, and thus H-3 and H-5 were α-oriented. The NOE interactions of H-9/H-5 and Me-27 implied the α-orientations of these protons and methyl group. Correspondingly, the NOE interactions of Me-26/Me-25 and H-13 suggested that H-13 and Me-26 were β-orientation. Finally, the absolute configuration of 1 was determined by comparing the alkaline hydrolysis products with those of 3, an acetylated derivative of morolic acid also isolated in the current research. Both compounds generated the same morolic acid product. As the absolute configuration of 3 was assigned as 3S,5R,8R,9R,10R,13S,14R,17S by using single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis [Flack parameter = −0.01 (6)] (Figure 4 in the current study), the structure of 1 with the same absolute configuration was established as depicted and named glochidpurnoid A.

After constantly stirring for an additional 7 h at 70 °C, the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. Next, the pure PFEE was obtained as the collected fraction through distillation at 108 °C–112 °C. Its structure was confirmed through 1H NMR and 13C NMR. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 4.09–3.89 (m, 2H, CH2 in O-CH2-CF2 and one molecule of CH2 in CH-CH2-O), 3.56–3.47 (m, 1H, one molecule of CH2 in CH-CH2-O), 3.21–3.15 (m, 1H, CH), 2.82–2.77 (m, 1H, one molecule of CH2 in ring), and 2.63–2.60 (m, 1H, one molecule of CH2 in ring); 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 121.72–115.58 (CF2), 115.01–110.89 (CF3), 72.94 (CH2 in CH-CH2-O), 67.82–67.47 (CH2 in O-CH2-CF2), 50.32 (CH), and 43.43(CH2 in the ring).  2.3.

Moreover, the values of the chemical shifts corresponded to the characteristic shifts of the carbon in the chemical environment, so the shift at position 9 corresponded to the characteristic shift of the O=C-C-X bond; the shift at position 2 corresponded to the shift associated with the Ar-C bond; the shift at positions 1, 3, and 5 corresponded to the shift associated with the C=C bond; the shift at position 7 corresponded to the shift of the C-O bond; and the shifts at positions 6, 10, 12, and 13 corresponded to the shifts of the C-C bond seen in the structure of ThBr.  Figure 10 shows the 1H NMR spectra of all obtained PEDOT-Br macroinitiator products with different monomer ratios. To determine the real ratios and their difference from the ratio of monomers in the reaction setup, integrals of known protons belonging to specific groups of individual monomers were used (shown in the Supplementary Materials). For this purpose, a signal numbered 13 and 14 corresponding to the protons of two equal CH3 groups of the ThBr molecule and a signal numbered 8, 23, 24 corresponding to the protons present in the two CH2 groups of the EDOT molecule and one CH2 group of the ThBr molecule were used. If we assume that the integral of signal 13, 14 is equal to 6 because it corresponds to six protons from the two CH3 groups of the ThBr molecule, then we can easily determine the EDOT content in each sample from the magnitude of the integral of the signal labelled 8, 23, 24 [25]. Such a calculation yielded the ratios shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the ratios obtained agreed quite well with the original ratios, although it was obvious that a slightly higher proportion of EDOT monomers than specified was present in all samples. It can be concluded that EDOT reacts more readily and rapidly during polymerization than ThBr itself. In addition, the appearance of the double signals seen in all products with more ThBr monomer (TE 1:1–TE 1:0.2) and in the 1H NMR of PThBr (Figure S12) indicates that the aliphatic chains of the ThBr monomer were randomly oriented in space and that the polymers were atactic. The signal at 1.56 ppm could be assigned to water present in CDCl3, which is used as an NMR solvent [43]. [/INST],\n",

Compound 1 displayed a molecular formula of C24H26O6 by HRESIMS, suggesting 12 degrees of unsaturation, and inspection of the 13C NMR showed 22 discrete signals (Table 1). The 1HNMR displayed an AA’BB’ system (H-1¢/6¢ 7.70 ppm and H-2¢/4¢ 6.80 ppm, J = 8.8 Hz). The 13C NMR data also confirmed the presence of a trioxygenated aromatic ring and a benzoyl group consistent with the basic 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone core observed in the vismiaphenone family of compounds (Hussain et al., 2012). The NMR spectra of compound 1 showed several similarities to vismiaphenone F, possessing a para-substituted ring A, a fully substituted ring B, and a 2,2 dimethyl chromene moiety. Analysis of the 2D NMR spectra (HSQC, HMBC, and COSY) revealed that the 2-methyl-2-butenyl group had been oxidized to the epoxide (dC-8 69.0 ppm, dC-9 77.6 ppm), and additionally, significant cross peaks were observed between H-8 (3.70 ppm) and C-5, C-7, and C-11.

In brief, a drug-loaded calcium phosphate core was synthesized using the reversed-phase microemulsion method, and the resultant precipitate was then combined with additional lipids in chloroform to form a thin film under high vacuum. After that, 5% glucose (Glu) solution was added to hydrate lipid film to obtain Nano-reshaper. ApoE-CaCP (without pLIGHT) and ApoE-pLIGHT@CaP (without CP) were synthesized using the identical procedure, with the exception of the different components in cores. Since the inner calcium phosphate cores were precipitated via the phosphate group’s interaction with calcium ions46, it was challenging to encapsulate and formulate lipophilic CBD for systemic delivery. Thus, we phosphorylated CBD via the hydroxyl groups to maximize loading efficiency (LE) by precipitating with calcium to form an amorphous core (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The obtained CP was confirmed by mass spectrum, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (Supplementary Figs. 1b, c and 2–4). In addition, we found that CP showed reduced cytotoxic effect on GL261 cells compared to CBD (Supplementary Fig. 5), which might be that CP needed to be converted to active compound CBD within the cells.Fig. 2 Preparation and characterization of Nano-reshaper.  a Scheme for the preparation process of Nano-reshaper. b Size distribution of Nano-reshaper detected by DLS and visual appearance. c, d TEM image and particle size distribution.

The presence of a 5β, 6β-epoxy-3,4 β-dihydroxy-1-one unit in rings A and B was deduced from the signals at δ 2.87 (2H, d, m), 4.16 (1H, m), 3.90 (1H, d, J = 7.27) and 1.52 (1H, m) and 1.89 (1H, brs) assigned to H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-7, respectively. The deduced pattern of rings A and B was finally confirmed by the carbon signals at δ ppm 210.14 (C-1). The hydroxylation at C-3 and C-4 was concluded from the downfield shift of their carbons at δ ppm 77.83 and 78.69 respectively. The allocation of C-5 and C-6 at δ ppm 72.97 and 63.52 respectively was the final confirmation of the presence of 5β, 6β-epoxy moiety. The δ-lactone side chain became evident from the characteristic signals at δ ppm 1.73 and 1.62 each integrated for 3H (two olefinic methyls, H-27, H-28 respectively) and a multiplet at δ ppm 4.62 (H-22). Moreover, the 13C NMR data displayed one carbonyl carbon (δ C 166.78), and two olefinic carbons (δ C 154.48 and 119.9) characteristic for the δ-lactone side chain. The downfield shift appearances of H-21 methyl at δ ppm 1.24 as a singlet signal with the absence of H-20; indicate the presence of an oxygen function at C-20. The presence of a γ-lactone carbonyl deduced from the presence of a carbonyl signal at δ ppm 175.26; together with the absence of 18-methyl in 13C NMR data suggest the presence of γ-lactone like that of the withaphysalins [36]. The presence of a hydroxyl group at C-14 was deduced from the downfield shift at δ ppm 87.68. The positive ESI–MS spectrum of Compound 3 gave a final confirmation of the structure that showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 517.24 [M + H]+, corresponding to the molecular weight 516.24.

Commercially available 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (1–1) was treated with iodoethane to give 1–2, which was refluxed in nitromethane to obtain 1–3 under the catalysis of ammonium acetate. Then compound 1–3 was reduced by LiAlH4 to give key intermediate 1–4. 5-Methoxy-1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde (1–5) was reacted with the wittig reagent methyl 2-(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)acetate (1–6) to give the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ester 1–7, which was converted to the saturated ester 1–8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Hydrolysis of compound 1–8 afforded the key intermediate acid 1–9. Amide 1–10 was generated by a coupling reaction of intermediates 2-(4-ethoxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-amine (1–4) and 3-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (1–9). Then, amide 1–10 was treated with POCl3 to afford the dihydroisoquinoline compound 1–11. Asymmetric reduction with Noyori catalyst gave the S-isomer 1–12, which was subjected to react with 4-morpholinecarbonyl chloride to provide the target product DC591053.

A round-bottomed flask was charged with THF (100 mL), and compound 5 (4 g, 4.3 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved. A solution of TBAF in THF (2M, 4.3 mL, 8.6 mmol, 2 equiv) was added and stirred overnight at room temperature. After completion of the reaction, THF was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was washed with water (2 × 200 mL) and extracted with chloroform (2 × 300 mL). Organic layers were combined and dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and OPCA was obtained as pure (white solid, 85% yield). Further purification was performed by recrystallization or precipitation via a chloroform–methanol mixture.

Briefly, the proligands HL1–5 and the NC proligands 4-MeOppyH and 3-MeOppyH were synthesized through Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, while HL6 was synthesized through a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The PtLnCl complexes were then obtained by refluxing the tridentate proligands with K2PtCl4 in acetic acid. While PtL1Cl and PtL6Cl were established from the work of Constable et al.,25 and PtL2Cl was explored by Che and co-workers,30 PtL2–4Cl were used solely en route to their Pt—C≡C—Ar acetylide adducts, and there is no previous report of PtL5Cl. We provide data for all six compounds in the Supporting Information. The synthesis and characterization of PtL1Cl3 and [PtL1(ppy)Cl]PF6 are described below, as representative examples of these two classes of new compounds, together with [Pt(L1)2](PF6)2. Details for all other compounds are given in the Supporting Information.  PtL1Cl3 Chlorine gas, generated by dropwise addition of HCl to solid KMnO4, was bubbled through a solution of PtL1Cl (250 mg, 0.54 mmol) in CHCl3 for 10 min, with the partial exclusion of light. A pale-colored precipitate formed, and the mixture was left to stir for a further 1 h. The solid was separated and extracted into CH2Cl2 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield the product as a pale-yellow solid (189 mg, 90% yield). 1H NMR (599 MHz, DMSO-d6): δH 9.10 (dd, J = 5.0, 1.5, 1H, H1), 8.85 (d, J = 8.0, 1H, H4), 8.63 (d, J = 8.0, 1H, H7), 8.49–8.44 (m, 2H, H3, H9), 8.42 (t, J = 8.0, 1H, H8), 8.06 (dd, J = 7.5, 5.5, 1H, H2), 7.97 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.5, 1H, H12), 7.59 (dd, 3J195Pt–1H ≈ 27, J = 8.0, 1.0, 1H, H15), 7.38 (td, J = 7.5, 1.5, 1H, H14), 7.28 (td, J = 7.5, 1.0, 1H, H13). 13C NMR (151 MHz, DMSO-d6): δC 148.8 (C1), 144.1 (C8), 142.4 (C3 or C9), 133.0 (C14), 132.6 (C15), 129.6 (C2), 127.7 (C12), 127.0 (C13), 126.4 (C4), 123.1 (C3, C9, or C7).

For each strain three biological replicates were used. For each sample, two agar plugs of 1,8 cm2 were taken from 3 plates. Agar plugs were collected in 15 mL tubes and 3 mL of 50% acetone in water (v/v) was added and put into an ultrasonic bath for 15 min for better dilution. Subsequently 1 mL of chloroform was added. Tubes were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000 g for 1 min for phase separation. The organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and chloroform extraction was repeated twice before the vials were left for evaporation over night. The dry extracts were redissolved in 140 μL methanol and stored in glass vials at − 20 °C before analysis.  Analytical HPLC measurements were performed on Agilent 1100 series coupled with UV-diode array detection at 230 nm and a Hypersil BDS column (100 × 4 mm, 3 µm grain size). An aq. buffer (15 mM H3PO4 and 1.5 mM Bu4NOH) (A) and MeOH (B) was used as eluents. The following elution system was applied: From 55–95% B within 8 min, and 95% B was kept for 5.0 min, with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1. The injection volume was 5.0 µL.  Statistics  Statistical significance was evaluated by the t-test in R-studio (compare means, ggpubr version 0.4.0) **p value < 0.01, *p value < 0.05. At least three biological replicates were considered in every assay.  NMR spectroscopy  For NMR spectroscopic measurements (21S)-bisorbibutenolide was dissolved in CD3OD (~ 4.2 mg in 0.7 mL) and transferred into 5 mm high precision NMR sample tubes. All spectra were measured on a Bruker DRX-600 at 600.18 MHz (1H) or 150.91 MHz (13C) and performed using the Topspin 3.5 software. Measurement temperature was 298 K ± 0.05 K. 1D spectra were recorded by acquisition of 64 k data points and Fourier transformed spectra were performed with a range of 7200 Hz (1H) and 32,000 Hz (13C), respectively. To determine the 2D COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra 128 experiments with 2048 data points each were recorded, zero filled and Fourier transformed to 2D spectra with a range of 6000 Hz (1H) and 24,000 Hz (HSQC) or 32,000 Hz (HMBC) (13C), respectively. Residual CD2HOD was used as internal standard for 1H NMR measurements (δH 3.34) and CD3OD for 13C NMR measurements (δC 49.0).  Mass spectrometry  Mass spectra were measured on a high resolution time-of-flight (hr-TOF) mass spectrometer (maXis, Bruker Daltonics) by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and negative ionization mode (mass accurancy +/− 5 ppm). TOF MS measurements have been performed within the selected mass range of m/z 100–2500. ESI was made by capillary voltage of 4 kV to maintain a (capillary) current between 30 and 50 nA. Nitrogen temperature was maintained at 180 °C using a flow rate of 4.0 L min−1 and the N2 nebulizer gas pressure at 0.3 bar.

To a flame-dried 50 ml Schlenk flask was added 0.150 g of 2Se (0.302 mmol, 1.00 eq.) dissolved in 20 ml dry DCM (15.1 mM). Afterwards, 85.5 µl methyl tri­fluoro­methane­sulfonate (0.124 g, 0.756 mmol, 2.50 eq.) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room tem­per­ature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude solid was washed three times with di­ethyl ether and three times with pentane, and then dried under high vacuum. The crude solid was dissolved in the minimum amount of aceto­nitrile and precipitated by the addition of di­ethyl ether. The solid was filtered off and dried under high vacuum.

Removal of the hexane under reduced pressure gave the electrophilic reagent 4 as a pale-yellow solid which was used without further purification or characterization. The electrophilic reagent 4 was then added to a solution of pyri­din-3-amine (4; 0.56 g, 2.99 mmol) in aceto­nitrile (10 ml) and anhydrous tri­ethyl­amine (1 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, the solvent removed under reduced pressure and the residue crystallized from hot DMF giving com­pound 2 as off-white plates (m.p. 272–274 °C; yield 0.76 g, 90%). 1H NMR (d 6-DMSO): δ 8.85 (1H, brs), 8.43 (1H, d, J = 4.7 Hz), 8.08 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz), 8.04 (1H, ddd, J = 8.3, 7.2, 1.5 Hz), 7.90 (1H, dd, J = 7.7, 1.4 Hz), 7.68 (1H, ddd, J = 8.2, 2.7, 1.4), 7.45–7.49 (1H, m). 13C NMR (d 6-DMSO): δ 166.16, 146.95, 145.97, 139.58, 137.27, 133.12, 132.44, 128.60, 128.45, 126.94, 126.55, 124.59.

Because there are too many quaternary carbon and nitrogen atoms in the molecule, it was difficult to further determine the planar structure of PM-3. Fortunately, a tiny crystal was generated in the methanol solvent by solvent evaporation after many attempts. Finally, the complete structure of PM-3 was determined by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2c) and it was identical to pseudoiodinine.  Quantitative analysis of pseudoiodinine production [/INST],\n",

Initially, preparation of α,α’-dibrominated and dichlorinated meso-free BODIPY’s 8-Br and 8-Cl were attempted by halogenations of di(2-pyrroyl)methane 7 with NBS and NCS. But these attempts failed due to the instabilities of 8-Br and 8-Cl. We chose regioselective chlorination of BODIPY’s with CuCl2 developed by Jiao and Hall27. BODIPY 9 was prepared by oxidation of 7 with p-chloranil in CH2Cl2 at −40 °C under nitrogen followed by reaction with BF3•OEt2 in 38% yield. Then, the reaction of 9 with CuCl2 and Cu(OTf)2 under refluxing acetonitrile gave 10 in 55% yield (Fig. 4).

The filtered and combined extract was evaporated, resulting in 67.8 g (yield 11.3%) of crude extract. A portion of the sample (50 g) of this extract was subjected to column chromatography (CC) on a Diaion HP20SS (12 × 50 cm, 1.2 kg) eluted with MeOH/H2O mixed solvents (10:90 (2 L), 30:70 (2 L), 50:50 (4 L), 70:30 (4 L), 90:10 (2 L), and 100:0 (2 L)), to provide seven fractions (A–G). Fraction B (3.2 g) was fractionated on an C18 column cartridge using MPLC with a linear gradient of 35–50% MeOH/H2O at an 18 mL/min flow rate to afford 5 fractions (B1–B4). The B3 subfraction, enriched with 1 and 2, was purified by preparative HPLC using 50% MeOH as mobile phase and afforded 1 (124 mg) and 2 (2.7 mg). Fractions C–E (8.9 g) enriched with 3–6 were fractionated via RP-MPLC with a linear gradient of 45–60% MeOH/H2O to give fractions C1–C9. The C3 subfraction, enriched with 3 and 4, was further purified by recycling preparative HPLC using 55% MeOH in H2O and afforded 3 (184 mg) and 4 (92 mg). Subsequent separation of subfractions (C5–C7), enriched with 5 and 6, were combined and further purified by recycling preparative HPLC mode using 40% ACN in H2O as the mobile phase to afford 5 (5.2 mg) and 6 (7.4 mg). Fraction F (0.7 g) enriched with 7 on Sephadex LH-20 with 60% ACN as the eluent yielded 7 (16.4 mg).

The organic extract was evaporated to give a dark brown residue that was partitioned between Et2O and H2O. The upper layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to give an Et2O portion (13.5 g). The Et2O extract was separated into twenty-one fractions (A–U) by gradient silica gel column chromatography [0 → 100% Et2O (EE) in petroleum ether (PE)]. Fraction G was further purified by Sephadex LH-20 [PE/CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1:1)], followed by silica gel column chromatography [PE/EE (4:1)] to give seven subfractions G1–G7. The sixth subfraction G6 was further purified by RP-HPLC [MeCN/H2O (85:15), 3.0 mL/min] to give compound 3 (1.8 mg, tR = 36.7 min). Similarly, fraction J was further purified by Sephadex LH-20 [PE/CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1:1)], followed by silica gel column chromatography [PE/EE (2:1)] to yield seven subfractions J1–J7. Compound 2 (3.6 mg) was isolated from the seventh subfraction J7 by silica gel column chromatography [PE/EE (2:1)]. Through two-step purification, including Sephadex LH-20 [PE/CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1:1)] and silica gel column chromatography [PE/ acetone (3:1)], fraction Q was divided into four subfractions, Q1–Q4. The first subfraction Q1 gave compounds 8 (3.1 mg) and 10 (4.3 mg) by silica gel column chromatography [PE/ acetone (7:3)] along with five mixtures Q1A–Q1E. Four mixtures Q1A, Q1B, Q1D, and Q1E yielded compounds 5 (2.5 mg, tR = 17.4 min), 6 (2.0 mg, tR = 16.9 min), 7 (12.0 mg, tR = 10.0 min), and 9 (3.4 mg, tR = 9.7 min) by RP-HPLC [MeCN/H2O (20:80), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (40:60), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (20:80), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (38:62), 3.0 mL/min], respectively.

Four mixtures Q1A, Q1B, Q1D, and Q1E yielded compounds 5 (2.5 mg, tR = 17.4 min), 6 (2.0 mg, tR = 16.9 min), 7 (12.0 mg, tR = 10.0 min), and 9 (3.4 mg, tR = 9.7 min) by RP-HPLC [MeCN/H2O (20:80), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (40:60), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (20:80), 3.0 mL/min; MeCN/H2O (38:62), 3.0 mL/min], respectively. The second subfraction Q2 yielded compound 1 (8.0 mg, tR = 12.5 min) by silica gel column chromatography [PE/acetone (7:3)] followed by RP-HPLC [MeCN/H2O (65:35), 3.0 mL/min]. Compound 4 (3.6 mg, tR = 4.9 min) was obtained from the fraction R by the two-step purification, including Sephadex LH-20 [PE/CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1:1)] and the subsequent RP-HPLC [MeCN/H2O (50:50), 3.0 mL/min].  3.4.

Next, the two groups of high and low signals were analyzed. One secondary methyl (δH 1.22, d, (J = 6.9 Hz); δC 21.0 (CH3)), an oxygenated methine (δH 4.02, q, (J = 6.9 Hz); δC 66.3 (CH)) and one carbonyl (δC 176.9 (C)) were distinguished in the group with high signals in the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT spectra (Figures S11 and S12). The 1H–1H COSY correlation between the protons at δH 1.22 (H-3) and the proton at δH 4.02 (H-2) (Figure S13), as well as the HMBC correlations between H-3 and H-2 and the carbonyl (δC 176.9, C-1) (Figure S14), suggest that the secondary methyl, the oxygenated methine and the carbonyl were connected to form the structure of LA (Figure 4A). The quasimolecular ion peak at m/z 89.0244 (calcd. for C3H5O3− [M − H]− 89.0244) in the HR-ESI-MS further supported the presence of LA as a major constituent in 1-1-4-3. As for the low-signal group, the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT spectra displayed characteristic signals for two secondary methyls (δH 0.89 and 0.93, each d, (J = 7.0 Hz); δC 18.1 and 19.3 (each CH3)); two methines, including a nitrogenated one (δH 3.12, d, (J = 3.6 Hz); δC 59.9 (CH)); and a carbonyl (δC 170.0 (C)). As shown in Figure 4A, the observed 1H–1H COSY correlations between H-2′/H-3′ and H-3′/H-4′(H-5′) indicated the moiety of CH-2′–CH-3′(–CH3-5′)–CH3-4′, which was linked to the carbonyl (δC 170.0, C-1′) by the key HMBC correlation between H-2′ and C-1′. Therefore, the component with low content was determined to be valine, whose molecular weight was also consistent with the HR-ESI-MS ion peak at m/z 118.0863 (calcd. for C5H12NO2+ [M + H]+ 118.0863). In addition, the 1D NMR and HPLC analysis of the authentic samples, LA and valine, as well as an analysis of their mixture (LA and valine at a ratio of 2:1), were also performed. By comparing the 1D NMR data (Table 1 and Figures S15–S22) and HPLC spectra (Figure 4B–E) of 1-1-4-3 with those of LA, valine, and their mixture, it was further confirmed that 1-1-4-3 contained LA and valine.  2.5.

The IR spectrum of 2 (Figure S11) showed the existence of C=O (1735 cm−1) and -OH (3418 cm−1).The 1H NMR (Table 1 and Figure S12) of 2 confirmed two methyl groups [δH 2.24 (3H, s), δH 2.04 (3H, s)], one methylene [δH 3.92 (1H, dd, J = 10.8, 6.6 Hz) and 4.10 (1H, dd, J = 11.4, 3.6 Hz)], and four methines [δH 6.05 (1H, s), 7.31 (1H, s), 4.51 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz), 3.86 (1H, m)]. The 13C NMR (Table 1 and Figure S13) analysis displayed 10 carbon signals in total at δC 13.4, 20.7, 68.6, 66.9, 73.8, 106.1, 127.8, 139.6, 153.9, and 172.9. A comparison of the above 1D NMR data of 2 with those of 2-methyl-4-(1-glyceryl)-furan (3) revealed that the structures were similar, except for the presence of an acetyl group in 2 at C-8, which was consistent with the molecular formula and further confirmed by key 1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC correlations (Figure 3 and Figure S14–S16). Both 2 and co-purified 2-methyl-4-(1-glyceryl)-furan (3) had positive specific rotation and shared similar biosynthetic origins; supporting the absolute configuration of 2 were 6R and 7R, in accordance with 3. Thus, the structure of 2 was determined as shown and named as Nicardifuran E. [/INST],\n",

The UV spectrum showed maxima absorption bands at λmax 250, 277, and 322 nm suggesting the benzo[f]indole-4,9-dione framework [3], while the IR spectrum revealed absorption bands for carbonyl (1709 cm−1) and hydroxy (3404 cm−1) functionalities. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of 2 (Table 2) showed resonances for four aromatic protons of 1,2-disubstituted benzene [δH 7.70 (m, H-5 and H-8)/δC 126.8 (C-5), 126.7 (C-8) and 8.16 (m, H-6 and H-7)/δC 133.6 (C-6) and 133.3 (C-7)], an olefinic proton [δH 6.85 (s, H-2)/δC 129.3], a hydroxymethylene proton [δH 4.72 (s, H2-1′/δC 57.1)], and an N-methyl group [δH 4.07 (s, N-CH3)/δC 36.8]. The structure of 2 was further supported by the following key HMBC correlations (Figure 2): δH 6.85 (H-2) with C-3 (δC 126.2), C-1′ (δC 36.8), and N-CH3 (δC 57.1); δH 4.72 (H2-1′) with C-2 (δC 129.3), C-3 (δC 126.2), and C-3a (δC 162.2); δH 4.15 (N-CH3) with C-2 (δC 129.3) and C-9a (δC 131.8). Thus, compound 2 was named as gonioridleyindole (3-hydroxymethyl-1-methyl-1H-benzo[f]indole-4,9-dione). Many 3-hydroxymethylindolequinone derivatives, including compound 2, had previously been synthesized and functionalized to other indolequinones [18].

The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h before NaBH(AcO)3 (636 mg, 3 mmol) was added and the mixture was left to stir overnight. The reaction mixture was then quenched with 1M NaOH solution (15 mL), stirred for 30 min., diluted with water (10 mL) and extracted with DCM (2 X 10 mL). The organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using EtOAc/MeOH (4:1) to give the desired BM212 2a (366 mg, 95%) as a hygroscopic pale-yellow solid.

As shown in Figure S3 (Supplementary Materials), it is clear from the mass spectrum of fraction (C) that the most significant characteristic peaks are intense (at m/z 211.1, 193.1, 149, 121.1, and 104) and are attributed to the BHET monomer as reported in the literature [14,35]. 13C NMR of faction (C) is shown in Figure S4 in which the signal at 167.18 ppm indicates carbon of the carbonyl group (–COO–), and signals at 135.44 and 130.68 ppm indicate aromatic carbon associated with carbonyl groups and hydrogen respectively. The signal at 67.96 ppm indicates the presence of carbon in the methylene group along the carbonyl group and the signal at 61.06 ppm represented the carbon in the methylene group neighboring to the hydroxyl group (–OH). 1H NMR of fraction (C) is shown in Figure S5 in which the signal at 8.17 ppm indicates aromatic hydrogen, and the signal at 4.85 ppm indicates hydrogen of the hydroxyl group (–OH). The signal at 4.41 ppm indicates the presence of hydrogen in the methylene group along the carbonyl group and the signal at 3.88 ppm represented the hydrogen in the methylene group neighboring to the hydroxyl group (–OH). The NMR spectrum confirms the BHET as the main product of PET glycolysis and is consistent with the reported literature [16,36,37,38].  The melting point of commercial and produced BHET as well as of PET residue was measured using a melting point analyzer. The operating conditions and corresponding results are given in Table S1. The commercial BHET starts to melt at around 103.1 °C and melts completely up to 107.4 °C. On the other hand, produced BHET starts to melt slightly later around 107.8 °C but melts completely around 111.7 °C. The melting point of unconverted PET residue was also measured and it was found that residue starts melting around 162 °C but melts completely around 168 °C corresponding to the dimer melting temperature range [38]. The melting point of BHET is in accordance as reported in various studies 109–110 [39], 111 [40] and 113.34 °C [41] via DSC-analysis. The melting point analysis is further supported by DSC analysis (Figure S5) which shows that PET residue comprises only monomer and dimer peaks. The small melting peak at 107 °C indicates the presence of BHET monomer and is likely the result of the monomer precipitating with the dimer instead of being dissolved by the water during filtration. Therefore, it is apparent that glycolysis comprises a monomer-dimer equilibrium, and no PET substrate is present in the residue [42,43]. To validate this further, a series of control experiments were performed, varying the reaction time to understand the degradation mechanism. In Figure S6, three main DSC peaks were observed around 110, 150–160, and 250 °C, which were attributed to trace amounts of BHET (not completely extracted), dimers of different compositions, and unconverted PET respectively [44]. It can also be observed in Figure S6, that the peak related to PET remarkably decreased with degradation time and is attributed to an increase in the depolymerization rate and eventually the formation of BHET monomer.

According to the 1H NMR of RSG7 EPS (Figure 3A), the anomeric region and ring proton region were detected at the signals of δ 4.5–5.5 and δ 3.1–4.5 ppm, respectively (Kavitake et al., 2016). The anomeric proton signal at 4.90 ppm was assigned to α-(1→6) glycosidic linkage, which was consistent with the FT-IR result at the absorption peak of 1,018.96 cm–1 (Figure 2). While the anomeric proton signal at 5.24 ppm was attributed to the presence of α-(1→3) glycosidic linkage in the RSG7 EPS (Li et al., 2022). However, the extensive overlapping of the peaks in the ring proton region due to the shielding effects of hydroxyl groups in the EPS resulted in difficulties in the attribution of each signal, and a two-dimensional NMR should be carried out to distinguish the signals. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 3B), the anomeric carbon region was presented at δ 95–110 ppm and the ring carbon region at δ 50–85 ppm (Wang et al., 2019b). The typical peaks at 97.72 and 99.30 ppm corresponded to signals in the anomeric region of 1H NMR. According to these results, the anomeric carbon signals at 97.72 and 99.30 ppm and the anomeric region at 4.90 and 5.24 ppm were assigned to C1 (Figure 3B) and H1 (Figure 3A) in glucosyl residues, respectively. Meanwhile, peaks in the 77–85 ppm illustrated the presence of branched linkage in the RSG7 EPS (Kavitake et al., 2016). In addition, carbon resonances at 73.38, 71.38, 70.06, 69.50, 65.51, and 60.31 ppm were attributed to the C2–C6 in the glucosyl residues. Further analysis based on 13C NMR and DEPT135 spectrum suggested that peaks of 65.51 and 60.31 ppm were both assigned to the C6 in glucosyl residues, and the C6 of the former peak involved in the formation of glycosidic bonds, while the latter was unsubstituted in the RSG7 EPS.

The carboxyl group gives its signal at 172.7 ppm. The aliphatic carbon carrying NH3+ and aromatic ring give their signals at 55.5 ppm and 35.9 ppm, respectively. The aromatic ring carbon produces its characteristic signal between 110 and 140 ppm. The aromatic ring carbon carrying the alkyl position gives its signal at 126.8 ppm. The ortho and meta carbons of the ring with an alkyl substituent give their signals at 132 and 117.2 ppm, respectively. The para carbon carrying on substitute shows its signal at 156.4 ppm. The proton NMR spectrum (Fig. 7) of the purified LT sample was recorded. The ortho hydrogen (proton) atoms in the aromatic structure can see each other as aligned (parallel) or opposed (antiparallel) and come to resonance twice. Thus, the ortho protons appear as doublets. These doublets have been seen at δ = 6.86 and δ = 7.16 ppm with the splitting factor of J = 8.4. The aliphatic CH proton has given its signal as triplet at δ = 4.27 ppm with the splitting factors of J = 5.6 and 7.2. The doublet signal at δ = 3.2 ppm is due to CH2. The multiple splitting is due to the presence of NH3 in the molecular structure.Fig. 6. 13C NMR spectrum of l-tyrosine extracted from Rhizopus oryzae strain AUMC14899  Fig. 7. 1H NMR spectrum of l-tyrosine extracted from Rhizopus oryzae strain AUMC14899 [/INST],\n",

The results were validated by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Figure S2, S3 and Table S1,S2, Supporting Information). In addition, the protein 4.2 (P4.2), a cytoskeletal protein in RBC that consists of multiple fragments, has specific affinity for the intracellular domain of protein band 3, which is distributed in RBC membranes.[ 11 ] To further functionalize the polymeric prodrug to right‐side‐out orientated coupling on the inner leaflet of RBC cell membrane, we further reacted the cysteine terminated peptide sequence LFVRRGQPFTIILYC with LVT‐PEG2K‐Mal to obtain the functional polymeric prodrug (LVT‐PEG2K‐P) via Michael reaction between maleimide and sulfhydryl groups (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The results were successfully confirmed based on the matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF‐MS) (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces (Figure S5, Supporting Information). In addition, the critical micelle concentration for LVTNP self‐assembly was 1.8 × 10−5 g mL−1 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Unlike the traditional methods with additional procedures to enforce the cell membrane coating on nanoparticles, the preparation of well‐defined RBC‐LVTNPs is a simple and convenient method, which involves the coincubation of the RBC membranes and LVTNP self‐assembly without any additional treatment via coextrusion or ultrasound (Figure  1A).

The presence of a glucosyl moiety was also confirmed by an anomeric proton at δH 4.81 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz, H-1″) together with the glucosyl carbon signals at [δC 101.9 (C-1″), 73.3 (C-2″), 76.0 (C-3″), 70.6 (C-4″), 74.3 (C-5″), 63.5 (C-6″)]. The HMBC correlations from H-2/6 and H-2′/6′ to C-7 (C=O) suggested the presence of a benzophenone skeleton. The position of the glucose was determined to be located at C-3 on the basis of HMBC correlation from the anomeric proton (H-1″) to C-3.

The procedure for the synthesis of compound 4b was adapted from a procedure reported in the literature [29,30]: Maltol (1) (7.5 g, 59.5 mmol, 1.0 eqv) was added to hot water (150 mL) in the presence of glycine (3) (8.9 g, 119.0 mmol, 2.0 eqv). To promote total dissolution, the mixture was stirred and heated to 80 °C. The pH of the solution was increased to 9 by the dropwise addition of 6 M NaOH solution and monitored by pH paper. The mixture was brought to reflux and maintained for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (RT), and almost all water was removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The pH of the crude product was brought to ~3 with the addition of a 6 M HCl solution, at which time a beige solid precipitated was formed. The precipitate was isolated by filtration and was subsequently recrystallized from hot water and stored at 4 °C overnight. The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with distilled water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h, to yield a beige solid, which was identified as compound 4b (3.5 g, 27%). m.p.: 256.5–257.4 °C. 1H NMR (300.0 MHz, D2O/NaOD) δ (ppm): 2.25 (s, 3H, H-7), 4.59 (s, 2H, H-2′), 6.41 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), 7.34 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 1H, H-5). 13C NMR (75.0 MHz, D2O/NaOD) δ (ppm): 11.9 (C-7), 58.2 (C-2′), 111.7 (C-5), 135.4 (C-2), 135.6 (C-6), 151.3 (C-3), 171.5 (C-4), 174.6 (C-1′).

[22]. Briefly, a mixture of sclerotiorin (1) (2.6 mM) and reactive amine (5.2 mM) was stirred in ethanol aqueous solution (50% H2O/50% Ethanol) in the presence of phosphate (0.2 M, pH7) for 120 h at 30 °C, until sclerotiorin (1) was completely consumed (monitored by thin layer chromatography, developing solvent: chloroform/methanol/H2O = 56/10/0.9). The mixture reaction was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Compounds 24′ and 39′ were purified by liquid–liquid extraction (chloroform/H2O) and compound 50′ by preparative thin layer chromatography (developing solvent: chloroform/methanol/H2O = 56/10/0.9).

The dominant desulfoglucosinolate (dGSL) signal at tR = 1.64 min and m/z 334 was assumed to be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl GSL (glucoconringiin, 31) based on a previous report by Olsen and Sorensen (1979) [27]. The MS2 spectrum (Figure S4A) revealed characteristic fragments, the origins of which were previously explained (a, b, and c fragments), and a fragment specific to hydroxylated aliphatic dGSLs that originated from water loss (type f, m/z 316). As no standard was available, the GSL was isolated from the flower due to its high amount (52.72 µmol g−1 DW), and NMR spectra of its desulfo-counterpart were recorded (Figure 2 and Figure S5A–D). The H-1/H-2 and H-5/H-6a/H-6b spin systems’ coupling constants correspond to a thioglucosyl moiety. Additionally, two distinct doublets were found between two H-8 protons (2J = 15.2 Hz) at 2.83 and 2.74 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, two singlets at 1.35 and 1.33 ppm, respectively, denote two methyl groups (H-10a and H-10b). Finally, according to 13C NMR, the same methyl groups are represented by two peaks at 28.5 and 27.9 ppm, and the precise quaternary carbon that those methyl groups are next to may be seen at 71.1 ppm.

Imidazole-functionalised R6G (I-R6G) was obtained through a simple, one-step amidation reaction of R6G with excess 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole under mild heating without a catalyst, resulting in a crystalline pink powder with an acceptable yield of 72% (Scheme 1a). During the reaction, an intermediate form with an amide bond undergoes intramolecular self-cyclisation to create a spirolactam functional group in the structure of I-R6G, in which an amide group bonds to the C9 atom of the xanthene conjugate group of I-R6G by nucleophilic attack [40,41,42], leading to the formation of a bulky heterocyclic aromatic structure. The recrystallised I-R6G exhibited the expected structural features (including molecular structure, weight and elemental composition), as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton/carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H- and 13C-NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and elemental analysis (EA) (see Supporting Information for more detail, Figures S1–S4 and Table S1). In addition, single-crystal X-ray diffraction clearly revealed that the crystal structure of I-R6G exists as a locked spirolactam moiety (Figure 1a). The spirolactam moiety is positioned almost orthogonally to the plane of the xanthene moiety in I-R6G, indicating a stable spatial arrangement between the spirolactam and xanthene moieties. Details of the crystal data and structure refinement for I-R6G are summarised in Figure 1b and the Supplementary Crystallographic Information File. After confirming the chemical structure of I-R6G, the solubility of I-R6G in different aqueous solutions and organic solvents was evaluated in order to explore the effect of introducing the imidazole and spirolactam moieties on the solubility of R6G. As shown in Figure 1c,d, I-R6G was highly soluble in common organic solvents and also displayed unique fluorescence under a long wavelength ultraviolet (UV) lamp. However, I-R6G was very difficult to dissolve in water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), even after the solution was heated to 60 °C for 1 day, suggesting that the presence of the imidazole and spirolactam moieties in the molecular structure of I-R6G profoundly affect its solubility and amphiphilic properties compared to water-soluble pristine R6G. Similar trends in the solubility of I-R6G were also observed in ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As presented in Figure S5, I-R6G in organic solvents exhibited clear absorption and florescence peaks, but did not exhibit any characteristic UV-Vis and PL peaks in water or PBS, further confirming that I-R6G is hydrophobic and is highly soluble in a wide range of polar and non-polar organic solvents, i.e., R6G reacted with 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole was fully converted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Therefore, this intriguing finding motivated our inquisitiveness to explore the environmental-responsive behaviour of I-R6G in aqueous solution. [/INST],\n",

The chemical structure of the produced aliphatic polyesters was assessed by proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Scheme 1 presents the numbered structures of the studied polymers. The part of the structure corresponding to carbons 1â€“4 appears basically at the same shifts for all samples and the assigned chemical shift in 1H and 13C remain at approximately the same positions (Figure 2). The 1H-NMR spectra of PBSu and its biocomposites are shown in Figure 2a. The 1H-NMR resonance signal of pure PBSu appears at 2.62 ppm and gives a single peak, which is associated with the methylene protons (2) in the succinic moiety. The resonances at 1.71 and 4.11 ppm are respectively assigned to the methylene protons (4) and (3) in the 1,4-butanediol unit. Figure 2b depicts the 13C NMR spectra of the synthesized polymers. As mentioned above, the peaks of all samples corresponding to carbons 1â€“4 remain basically the same. At 172.2 ppm, the deprotected carbons of the carbonyls (1) are recorded, and at 28.9 ppm, the carbons (2) of the methylene groups. The carbons that are adjacent to the oxygen atom of the ester bond (3) give a peak at 64.1 ppm, while the other methylene carbons of the aliphatic chains (4) appear at 25.1 ppm. Thus, the NMR spectra demonstrated successful synthesis of the PBSu and PBSu/BC biocomposites. The results are in accordance with the literature [33,34].  The XRD pattern of PBSu and its biocomposites is presented in Figure 3. The unit cell of the Î±-form of PBSu crystals is monoclinic, and the diffraction peaks of the crystal planes (020), (021), and (110) are shown in Figure 3 at angles 2Î¸ = 20.1Â°, 21.3Â°, and 23.2Â°, respectively, which are in accordance with the literature [35,36]. These peaks are also observed in biocomposites while BC is completely amorphous. The addition, the BC does not affect the crystal form of PBSu. No shift of the PBSu peaks is observed, indicating that the unit cells of the polyester and the BC remain the same. Most probably, the same stands also for the density of the crystals and the chain packing. [/INST],\n",

The yield of the synthesis was 90.33%.  1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O, 298 K): δ (ppm): Cation: 4.07–4.04 (4H, m, H2), 3.56 (2H, q, JCH2,CH3 = 7.5 H, CH2), 3.53–3.44 (4H, m, H3), 3.17 (3H, s, N-CH3), 1.39 (3H, tt, C–CH3); Anion: 3.59 (6H, d, JH, P = 10.5 Hz, CH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CD3CN, 298 K): δ (ppm): Cation: 61.27 (C2), 61.27 (CH2), 60.03 (C3), 46.91 (N–CH3), 7.60 (C–CH3); Anion: 52.23 and 52.18 (CH3).  The NMR spectra are presented in Figures S7 and S8 in Supplementary Material (SM). The structures of the iLs tested in this work are presented in Table 13. To remove remaining volatile chemicals and to decrease water content before measurements, every IL was drained for 48 h in a vacuum drying oven (Binder, model VD 23) at a temperature T = 373 K and under reduced pressure (P = 4∙10−4 mbar) obtained by a vacuum pump (Vacuubrand RZ 6). The water mass fraction of the dried IL was determined using Karl-Fischer titration (model SCHOTT Instruments TitroLine KF). The sample description, including the purities, water content, and purification methods, is presented in Table 14. [/INST],\n",

ADHICA (245 mg, 3 mM) and 1 molar eq of copper acetate (197 mg) were dissolved in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (329 mL, pH 7.5), and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 40 mg of sodium dithionite and acidification to pH 3 with 6 M HCl. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 200 mL), and the combined organic phases were filtered on anhydrous sodium sulphate and taken to dryness at a rotary evaporator. The residue (169 mg) was treated with 2 mL of acetic anhydride and 100 μL of pyridine overnight. After removal of the solvents, the acetylated mixture was dissolved in DMSO and purified by preparative HPLC to give the 4,4′-dimer of ADHICA in its acetylated form (150 mg, 75% yield).

The 1H NMR spectrum of AG showed six aromatic proton signals, three methoxyl signals, and one sugar moiety signal separately. Six proton signals upfield of δ 6.61–6.98 were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, which was characteristic of two 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring structures. In addition, there were three methoxyl signals at δ 3.69, 3.70, and 3.71 in the 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR spectrum of AG showed two carbonyl signals, twelve aromatic carbon signals, three methoxyl carbons signals, one anomeric carbon signal, and nine saturated carbon signals, separately. Thus, the aglycone of AG could be preliminarily determined as arctigenin based on the 1H NMR and 13C data and the comparison of literature. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra displayed one anomeric signal at δH 4.88 (d, J = 7.56 Hz) and δC 99.87, suggesting that there was one sugar moiety in AG. Further, the carbohydrate could easily be identified as β-d-glucuronic acid by negative mode ESI-MS fragments at m/z 371 [M-H-176]-, and TLC analysis of acidic hydrolysis of AG. The attachment sites of the carbohydrates in AG were determined as C-4′ by glycosylation, which was confirmed by HMBC analysis. Under further verification by DEPT 135, DEPT 90, HSQC, and HMBC spectrums, the structure of the derivative was elucidated as arctigenin-4′-O-glucuronide. The 1H and 13C NMR data of AG are listed in Table 1. All spectrums used above for structure elucidation were available in Supplementary Materials.  2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity [/INST],\n",

In the 1H NMR spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2A), six signals of anomeric proton occurred at 4.49, 5.07, 5.13, 5.19, 5.24 and 5.25 ppm. The signals of anomeric carbon appeared at 97.96, 98.28, 105.02, 109.43 and 110.76 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2B). According to the result of methylation analysis, it could be deduced that the anomeric carbon signals at 109.43 and 110.76 ppm were likely signals of α-linked arabinofuranose unit [19]. The 1H NMR spin systems of dsPCA were further assigned by the 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC spectra (Figure S2C,D). The H-1 of A at 4.49 ppm was related to the C-1 at 105.02 ppm, and the H-1 of D at 5.19 ppm was related to the C-1 at 98.28 ppm. The H-4/C-4 of A and H-6/C-6 of D were at 4.20/77.82 ppm and 3.70/65.12 ppm, respectively. Therefore, A was →4)-β-d-Galp-(1→ unit and D was →6)-α-d-Galp-(1→ unit. The H-1 of B at 5.07 ppm was related to the C-1 at 109.43 ppm. B was attributed to →2,5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ residue because of the down-field chemical shifts of C-2 at 84.30 ppm and C-5 at 71.05 ppm. The H-1 of C at 5.13 ppm was correlated to the C-1 at 97.96 ppm. The H-1 of E at 5.24 ppm was related to the C-1 at 110.76 ppm. E was assigned to →5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ residue because of the down-field chemical shifts of C-5 at 71.05 ppm. The H-4/C-of C4 was at 4.10/76.97 ppm, thus C was ascribed to →4)-β-l-Arap-(1→ unit. Compared with →4)-β-l-Arap-(1→ residue, the C-2 shift of F changed to low displacement above 75.86 ppm which represented F and was →2,4)-β-l- Arap-(1→ unit. By combining the data from the 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC spectra, the assignment of the main proton and carbon signals of the six sugar residues could be completed (Table 2).  The 1H–13C HMBC spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2E) gave the linkage sequences of various glycosidic units. The corresponding signals H-1 (C)/C-4 (C,F) showed the sequences [→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→] and [→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→]. The related signal H-5 (B)/C-1 (E) indicated the linkage [→2,5)-α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→]. The cross signal H-1 (D)/C-2 (F) confirmed the fragment [→6)-α-d-Galp-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→]. Moreover, the related signals H-2 (F)/C-1(E) confirmed the linkage [→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→]. The possible major disaccharides in dsPCA were listed in Figure 2. [/INST],\n",

The 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC spectra revealed the presence of 20 carbons signals resulting from for one methoxy, one methyl, one methylene, eight methines, and nine quaternary carbons, including one lactonic ester group at δC 165.7 (C-9). The 1H-NMR data (Table 2) displayed characteristic resonances for four aromatic protons at δH 6.61 (d, J = 2.2 Hz, H-1), 7.00 (2H, m, H-11, and H-13), and 7.34 (d, J = 1.9 Hz, H-3), one methoxy group at δH 3.99 (s, H-15), one methyl group at δH 2.85 (s, H-14), one oxygenated methylene at δH 3.71 (m, H-5′), four oxygenated methines at δH 4.20 (2H), 4.31, and 5.80. The HMBC correlations (Figure 2) from H3-15 to C-2 and C-6; H3-14 to C-10, C-7, and C-11; H-13 to C-8 and C-11 suggested the presence of alternariol methyl ether in the chemical structure of 3 [27]. The NMR data (Table 2) of compound 3 were very similar to those of 8, except the existence of five more oxygenated carbons at δC 101.5 (C-1′), 73.1 (C-2′), 88.2 (C-3′), 70.8 (C-4′), and 62.9 (C-5′) in 3. Considering the molecular formula, it is speculated that there should be a monosaccharide structure in 3, which was further confirmed by the COSY correlations of H-1′/H-2′/H-3′/H-4′/H-5′ and HMBC correlations from H-1′ to C-2′, C-3′, and C-4′. The HMBC correlation of the anomeric proton at δH 5.80 (d, J = 4.3 Hz) with C-12 (δC 158.7) determined its linkage site in compound 3. The chemical shift of the anomeric carbon (δH 5.80 and δC 101.5) confirmed the α configuration. The sugar moiety was further determined as D-arabinoside by hydrolysis and compared to the standard. Thus, 3 was named as alternariol methyl ether-12-O-α-D-arabinoside shown in (Figure 1). [/INST],\n",

[39]. In a typical batch, sodium (517 mg, 22.5 mmol, 6 eq.) was washed in inert n-heptane, cut into small pieces and added to a solution of pyrimidine (600 mg, 7.5 mmol, 2 eq.) in dry THF (15 mL) under an argon atmosphere. The surface of the metal chunks turned dark red at once. The suspension was vigorously stirred at room temperature and subjected to ultrasonication several times after half an hour of stirring, resulting in a dark purple solution that was further stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with absolute ethanol (12 mL) and triethylamine (0.6 mL), and pressurized air was bubbled through the solution for 2 h, upon which it turned yellow. The reaction mixture was extracted into methylene chloride and washed with water three times. The aqueous phase lost its color over time and was thus extracted into methylene chloride again. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure, upon which colorless needles formed. Recrystallization from methanol afforded fine colorless needles (374 mg, 2.4 mmol) in 63% yield.

Compound 1 (1 equivalent ratio) was reacted with an equimolar amount of N-benzylmaleimide 2 in the presence of lithium perchlorate (10 mol% in water). The chemical reaction was continued at a high temperature and routinely monitored by TLC analysis. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was concentrated. Then, 2-propanol was added to it and continued for 10 min. After 10 min, the reaction mixture was cooled down. The product was precipitated out and filtered.

Neosuberitenone (1) was the only compound that did not show any viral inhibitory effects at 25 µg/mL (6, 8, and 9 were not tested due to a lack of sample supply), suggesting that the ring D must be appended by a single bond to result in activity. Suberitenones A and B demonstrated the strongest antiviral potential of the tested compounds, with IC50 values of 7.9 and 3.5 µM, respectively, while suberitenone F (3) was also active (IC50 = 9.8 µM). The other isolated compounds had IC50 values ranging from 10.9–20.5 µM (Table S12), therefore suggesting that oxidation about ring C and removing the enone double bond of ring D are not likely to be alterations that would result in an increase in activity for future structure–activity relationship studies. The CC50 values were ~4–5 fold higher than the IC50 values for the newly isolated compounds (Table 3). Suberitenone B (11) showed the highest activity and greatest selectivity index.  Suberites sp. compounds were also submitted to a broad range of infectious disease screening. No antibacterial activity was detected against the ESKAPE pathogens, nor antifungal activity against several Candida strains. The cytotoxicity was assayed against the murine macrophage J774 cell line, where no significant activity (EC50 below 10 µM) was observed for any compound. Taken with low cytotoxicity, the selectivity of suberitenones A and B (10, 11) for RSV among other infectious diseases is noteworthy.  3. Materials and Methods  3.1. General Experimental Procedures  Optical rotations were measured using an AutoPol IV polarimeter at 589 nm. UV/Vis spectra were extracted from HPLC chromatograms. NMR spectra were acquired using either a Varian Inova 500 spectrophotometer or a Varian 600 MHz broadband spectrophotometer. The residual solvent peak was used as an internal chemical shift reference (CD3OD: δC 49.0; δH 3.31, CDCl3: δC 77.0; δH 7.26). High-resolution mass spectrometry−liquid chromatography data were obtained on an Agilent 6540 QTOF LCMS with electrospray ionization detection. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu LC20-AT system equipped with a photodiode array detector (M20A) using a preparative Phenominex C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 250 × 21.2 mm; 9 mL/min) or on a semipreparative Phenominex C18 column (10 μm, 100 Å, 250 × 10 mm; 4 mL/min). All of the solvents used for column chromatography were of HPLC grade, and H2O was distilled. Solvent mixtures are reported as % v/v unless otherwise stated.  3.2. Biological Material, Extraction and Isolation  Sponge specimens were collected in the austral fall, 2018, within a 3.5 km radius of Palmer Station, Antarctica (64° 46.50’ S; 64° 03.30’ W). The frozen sponge was freeze-dried (1.35 kg wet weight and 200 g dry weight) and then crushed by hand before being extracted in MeOH (1.6 L) twice overnight. The extracts were combined, were then passed through an HP20 column (250 mL), pre-equilibrated in H2O, and combined following elution. The eluent was then diluted with an equal volume of H2O and passed back through the column twice, followed by a 750 mL H2O wash. The column was then eluted with 750 mL portions of (1) 75% Me2CO/H2O and (2) Me2CO (fractions A1 and A2, respectively). Fraction A1 (5 g) was then reconstituted in MeOH (25 mL), filtered, and fractionated generating fractions (B1–B25) by repeated preparative C18 HPLC (9 mL/min) using the following method: 70% can/H2O (0.1% CH2O2) for 6 min, a linear gradient to 100% ACN over 8 min, and 100% ACN isocratic for 11 mins. Fraction B25 contained suberitenone A (~500 mg), while fraction B23 contained suberitenone B (~250 mg). Fraction B20 was purified using semipreparative C18 HPLC using a linear gradient from 50% MeOH/H2O (0.1% CH2O2) to 100% MeOH over 25 min to afford 1 (5.6 mg) and 2 (1.6 mg), while fractions B15, B16, B17, B18, B19, and B21 were also purified by the same method to afford 6 (0.8 mg), 4 (3.4 mg), 8 (0.8 mg) 3 (1.9 mg), 9 (0.8 mg), and 5 (6.5 mg), respectively.

Ammonium chloride (500 mg) was dissolved into 1.5 mL of water. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (1.54 g) was also dissolved into 1.5 mL of water. The ammonium chloride solution was slowly added to the dinitroaniline solution over the period of 5 min. The sodium sulfide solution was then added dropwise into the stirred mixture, which was maintained between 60 and 70 °C for a period of 30 min. In the process of adding sodium sulfide, the colour of the solution turned a brownish red with a yellow solid precipitating. After 30 min, the source of heating was removed. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8.0 with 2M hydrochloric acid, and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The product was extracted with 15 mL of ethyl acetate, yielding an orange solution. The removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation under 40 °C and 240 mbar yielded an orange-red solid. This product was purified by flash column chromatography (hexane: ethyl acetate—1:3, silica gel). Rotary evaporation yielded red needle shaped crystals of 3,5-diaminonitrobenzene. The crystals were recrystallised from water and dried over P2O5 to yield 3,5-diaminonitrobenzene (70%).

High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (HR-ESI-MS) showed a pseudo-molecular ion peak at m/z 497.3270 [M+H]+ (calculated C31H45O5, m/z 497.3267 [M+H]+), corresponding to the molecular formula C31H44O5 and 10 degrees of unsaturation. Analysis of 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT data (Table 3) showed that 2 had 11 quaternary carbons and 20 protonated (eight methyl, six methylenes, and six methines) carbon atoms. Compound 2 contained a group of typical signals of phloroglucinol [δC 187.0 (C-1), δC 106.8 (C-2), δC 171.4 (C-3), δC 57.8 (C-4), δC 196.4 (C-5), δC 107.3 (C-6)]. However, in comparison to 1, the molecular formula of 2 was found to contain 14 more mass units, suggesting the presence of an extra methylene. The available NMR data of 1 were compared with those derived from the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HMBC spectra of 2; it was found that both compounds 1 and 2 had the same parent nucleus. As expected, compound 2 also had a seven-membered ring connected to the six-membered ring, and one geranyl group along with a oxygenated prenyl unit was determined. 1H-NMR data showed that δH 1.35 (H-30) of 2 was different from 1 at δH 1.12 (H-30), and in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 2, H-30 (δH 1.35) and H-28 (δH 3.81) had a relevant signal. In the HMBC spectrum, H-30 (δH 1.35) was correlated with C-28 (δC 42.1), C-29 (δC 16.4), C-27 (δC 207.6), and C-31 (δC 12.0), and H-31 (δH 0.89) was related to C-28 (δC 42.1) and C-30 (δC 26.9), indicating that C-30 was connected to a methyl group.

The pharmacokinetic_ADME-related physio/chemical properties includes: partition coefficient in octanol-water system (Q_PlogPo/w), solubility in aqueous media (Q_PlogS), apparent permeability through Caco2-cells (Q_PPCaco) modelling the passive transportation across the blood/gut barrier, partition coefficient between blood and brain (Q_PlogBB) modelling the blood brain barrier penetration and CNS access, apparent permeability across kidney cells of Madin_Darby dog (Q_PPMDCK) modelling the blood/brain barrier, binding to human serum albumins (Q_PlogKHSA), and finally human’s percent oral absorption (%HOA) [62,63,64,65,66]. Evaluating the compound’s toxicological profile was proceeded through predicting the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for blocking HERG_Kv11.1-channels (Q_PlogHERG), Oral lethal dose 50 (LD50) on rats, as well as AMES_Mutagenicity test via TEST®-consensus approach [67]. Both LD50 and Q_PlogHERG represent the compound’s concentration (mg/Kg) needed for respective 50% rat death after a per oral administration or positive induction of colony growth with any Salmonella typhimurium strain.  3.

The first investigation of their 1H NMR spectra showed the signals of flavonol glycosides. In particular, the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3 was recorded in acetone-d6 [25] and in CD3OD [26] (Supplementary Figures S3–S13). In acetone-d6, two broad signals at δ 6.28 (H-6) and 6.48 (H-8) were detected and the two doublet A2X2 aromatic system protons at δ 7.13 (H-3′,5′) and 7.91 (H-2′,6′), J = 8.7 Hz, typical of a kaempferol residue. The presence of the anomeric proton at δ 5.83 (H-1″, brs), the methine protons at δ 5.62 (H-2, brs), 4.20 (H-3, dd, J = 9.7 and 3.0 Hz), 4.98 (H-4, t, J = 9.7 Hz), 3.39 (dd, J = 9.7 and 6.1 Hz) and the secondary methyl group at δ 0.86 (H-6, d, J = 6.1 Hz) suggested the presence of an α-rhamnopyranoside moiety substituted in position H-2″ and H-4″ by two p-coumaroyl residues, as observed from their typical signals. In particular, the signals of the double bonds H-2′′′ and H-3′′′ at δ 6.44 and 7.68 (J = 16.0 Hz) and H-2′′′′ and H-3′′′′at δ 6.31 and 7.56 (J = 16.1 Hz) revealed the presence of two E-configured double bounds. COSY spectrum (Supplementary Figures S7 and S8) confirmed the connections around the rhamnopyranoside and the positions of the p-coumaroyl residues at H-2″ and H-4″of the sugar residue for the downfield shifts showed by these protons. Through an extensive study of 2D 13C NMR spectra (HSQC and HMBC), the chemical shifts were assigned to all the carbons and protons (Supplementary Figures S10–S13). In this way, compound 3 was identified as kaempferol-3-O-α-L-(2″,4″-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnopyranoside as previously reported [25,26,27,28]. The identification was also supported by the data collected by the electrospray ionization (ESI) MS spectrum, which showed the protonated [M + H]+ ion at m/z 725. [/INST],\n",

Various amounts of PEI2k solution (water, HEC:PEI2k = 1:1, 1:5, or 1:10 w/w, respectively) were prepared and OxHEC solutions (water) were added to the PEI solution with continuous stirring. After 24 h of reaction under 25 °C in the dark, excessive sodium tetrahydroborate was added to the reaction mixture with continuous stirring. After an additional 24 h of reaction 25 °C in the dark, the solutions were dialyzed against ultra-pure water for 72 h. The products, HECP2k 1X, 5X, or 10X were obtained after lyophilization. The synthesis scheme of HECP2k is shown in Figure S1.  2.3. Characterization of HECP2k The synthesis of HECP2k was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR, respectively (600 MHz, AVANCE 600, Brucker, Germany). D2O was used as the solvent. Each sample was prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for 1H NMR and 50 mg/mL for 13C NMR.  The synthesis of the polymers was also confirmed using an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Once collected, the sponge was immediately frozen and kept at −20 °C until extraction. The frozen sponge (173.7 g wet weight) was chopped into small pieces and kept at −20 °C for 1h prior to lyophilization. After a 34 h lyophilization, the sponge (39.6 g dry weight) was extracted at room temperature with MeOH (3 × 0.7 L). The yellow colored MeOH extract was concentrated under a vacuum, until a volume of 500 mL of total extract remained. Then, 250 mL of H2O was added and the H2O-MeOH extract was concentrated under a vacuum reaching the volume of 500 mL. A second aliquot of 250 mL of H2O was added, and the extract was concentrated under a vacuum until 650 mL remained. The H2O-MeOH extract was first partitioned with H2O-saturated EtOAc. The resulting H2O layer was then partitioned with n-BuOH. The EtOAc (1.3 g) and n-BuOH (1.8 g) extracts were used for LC-MS/MS analysis. The EtOAc extract was chromatographed by normal-phase chromatography on a SiO2 column, using the elution step gradient n-hexane/EtOAc (1:1), n-hexane/EtOAc (2:8), 100% EtOAc, EtOAc/MeOH (9:1), EtOAc/MeOH (1:1), and 100% MeOH. The fraction eluted with 100% MeOH (106.8 mg) was subjected to two steps of reversed-phase HPLC separation. Initial HPLC purification was achieved on a Luna C18 column (250 × 10 mm, 10 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) [Eluent A: 0.1% HCOOH in H2O; eluent B: ACN; gradient program: 50% B 1 min, 50% → 80% B over 15 min, 80% → 95% B over 1 min, 95% B 5 min; flow rate 5 mL min–1, wavelength 330 nm].

Its HRESIMS in positive mode showed a sodium adduct ion [M + Na]+ at m/z 553.3491 (calculated as 553.3499 for C32H50O6Na+), indicating eight double bond equivalents. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1, Figure S1) exhibited signals of eight methyl singlets at δH 0.90 (3H, s, H-18), 1.08 (3H, s, H-19), 0.93 (3H, s, H-26), 1.23 (3H, s, H-27), 1.05 (3H, s, H-28), 1.15 (3H, s, H-29), 1.09 (3H, s, H-30), and 2.12 (3H, s, H-2′), and an olefinic proton at δH 5.37 (1H, brs, H-7). In addition, oxygenated methines were observed at δH 4.34/4.25 (1H, dt, J = 9.5, 4.8 Hz, H-23); 4.99/4.93 (1H, d, J = 5.4 Hz, H-24), and a hemi-acetal proton at δH 5.19/5.18 (1H, d, 5.3/3.6, H-21). The 13C NMR (Figure S2) and DEPT (Figure S3) data indicated 32 carbon resonances sorted into eight methyl groups at δC 22.3 (C-18), 11.7 (C-19), 21.7 (C-26), 25.2 (C-27), 23.6 (C-28), 25.4/25.3 (C-29), 26.4 (C-30), and 19.7/19.6 (OCOCH3); one hemi-acetal carbon at δC 101.0/96.7 (C-21); two carbonyl groups at δC 216.8 (C-3) and 170.8 (OCOCH3); and two olefinic carbons at δC 117.9 (C-7) and 145.7/145.6 (C-8). All these data were characteristic of limonoids of the tirucallane series, and they were superimposable over those of melianodiol [27,36,37]. The only difference was the additional signals of the acetyl group at δC 19.7/19.6 (C-1′) and 170.8 (C-2′) in compound 1. The proposed structure was supported by the 1H-1H COSY (Figure S6) and the HMBC correlations (Figure 2 and Figure S4). Compound 1 was a C-21 (δC 96.7/101.0) epimeric mixture similar to melianodiol, 21-methoxylmelianodiol, and other known tirucallane-types, possessing a similar hemiacetal side chain [27,38,39]. The relative configuration of the asymmetric carbons can be attributed to its structural similarities to melianodiol (3) [27]. Therefore, compound 1 was determined to be 24-acetoxy-21,25-dihydroxy-21,23-epoxytirucall-7-en-3-one. [/INST],\n",

For example, the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 4b (Figure S2) is in agreement with the structure of this compound. Proton signals of the quaternized pyridinium substituents were observed in the aromatic part. Their chemical shifts, relative intensity and multiplicity correspond with the structure of 4b. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 4b, signals with chemical shifts of 169.5 and 164.0 ppm were observed, corresponding to the carbon atoms of the triazine ring. The IR spectrum was recorded for compound 4c (Figure S3). The spectrum confirmed the presence of the perrhenate anion in the molecule, appearing as a characteristic band at 898 cm−1, slightly shifted from the corresponding band of sodium perrhenate (888 cm−1). In addition, a mass-spectrometry study of 4b was performed to demonstrate the highly intensive peak at 252.1 Daltons (Figure S4), corresponding to 4,6-dipyridinio-2-oxido-1,3,5-triazinecation.  For the two compounds 4a and 4b, whose structures were determined from the X-ray powder data, the experimental and different diffraction profiles after final bond-restrained Rietveld refinements are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. The crystal data, data collection and refinement parameters for both compounds are given in Table S1. [/INST],\n",

The titled compound was synthesized according to a procedure reported by Wilms et al. [40]. In a three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a Soxhlet extractor with a reflux condenser, Methyl 1-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)propionate 2 (1.000 g, 5.10 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (39 mg, 0.20 mmol) were suspended in 130 mL of benzene. The Soxhlet thimble was filled with CaCl2. 2,2-Dimethoxypropane (0.95 mL, 7.65 mmol) was syringed in and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight. The solvent was concentrated to a 20 mL volume and the solution was diluted with EtOAc (100 mL). The resulting solution was washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (2 × 50 mL), water (2 × 50 mL), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated to dryness to give a dark orange liquid. The latter was purified by column chromatography (eluent: cyclohexane/EtOAc, 100:0 to 80:20) to give 706 mg (2.99 mmol, 59% yield) of yellow liquid. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.65 (s, 6 H, CH3), 2.58 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2 H, CH2), 2.85 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2 H, CH2), 3.67 (s, 3 H, OCH3), 6.57–6.65 (m, 3 H, Harom). 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 26.0 (CH3), 30.9 (CH2), 36.2 (CH2), 51.7 (OCH3), 108.2 (CHarom), 108.7 (CHarom), 117.8, 120.6 (CHarom), 133.8, 146.0, 147.6, 173.5 (C=O).

The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at −50 °C. Then, it was allowed to warm to 25 °C, and it was stirred overnight. A total of 10 mL of water was added at 0 °C, and the reaction was stirred for 30 min at the same temperature. The phases were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3 × 30 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, gradient elution, hexane to EtOAc) to give 1.6 g (47%) of 1-adamantyl (4-trifluoromethyl)-H-phosphinate (1c) as a white solid. mp.: 97–100 °C; 31P NMR {1H} (202.5 MHz, CDCl3) δ 12.0; 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.90 (dd, J = 13.4, 7.9, 2H), 7.82 (d, J = 561.2, 1H), 7.74 (dd, J = 8.3, 2.8, 2H), 2.23 (s, 2H), 2.13 (d, J = 3.0, 7H), 1.66 (t, J = 3.1, 7H); 13C NMR {1H} (125.8 MHz, CDCl3) δ 136.0 (d, J = 136.2), 134.4 (dd, J = 32.7, 2.9), 131.6 (d, J = 11.9), 125.6 (dq, J = 14.0, 3.8), 123.7 (d, J = 272.5), 83.8 (d, J = 8.4), 44.3 (d, J = 4.6), 35.8, 31.3; HRMS (ESI/TOF) m/z: [M + Na]+ Calcd for C17H20F3NaO2P 367.1051; Found 367.1047.

The structures of molecules 1–6 have been confirmed by 1H-NMR/13C-NMR spectra and elemental analysis, and established on the basis of the performed 13C, 1H HMBC and HMQC correlations for the ethyl ester of 2-(4-oxo-8-phenyl-4,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[2,1-c][1,2,4]triazin-3-yl)acetic acid (1) [3]. The purity and homogeneity of all the compounds intended for thermal studies (1–6) have been previously evaluated under reaction and the purification conditions employed. All these ones have been obtained and described [3] as homogenous, pure, crystalline solids with sharp melting points and microanalyses within ±0.4 percent of the calculated values. They have been reported to reveal not only enhanced anticancer effects in malignant human multiple myeloma cells (MM1R, MM1S) but also antiproliferative activities against human tumours of the breast (T47D) and cervix (HeLa) [3]. In addition, their mode of anticancer action and very low toxicities towards normal human skin fibroblasts have been previously documented [3].  3.2. Thermal Analysis Methods [/INST],\n",

Fluorescent Microscope Analysis  Procedures of cell culture and live cell staining: Hela cells were seeded in RPMI-1640 medium at the density of 1 × 105 cells per dish with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a mixture of 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 100 units/mL penicillin, and then allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Hela cells were incubated with oleic acid (0.1 mM) for 24 h, and then stained with BY1 and BODIPY503 (10 µM) for 30 min. Fluorescence images were visualized by Nikon Ti-E&C2 scanning unit.  4. Conclusions  In summary, the NIR fluorescent probe BY1 was rationally designed and synthesized by integrating a TPA unit into rofecoxib via a one-step reaction. BY1 exhibited significant AIE property with a large Stokes shift of 234 nm. In addition, the mechanism of AIE was elucidated clearly by analyzing the single crystal X-ray data and Hirshfeld surfaces calculation. Moreover, the mechanochromic behavior could also be interpreted by these analyses of powder PXRD and DSC. Finally, BY1 exhibited highly specific (Pearson’s correlation: R = 0.97) imaging ability toward LDs in living HeLa cells. This work would be beneficial for guiding the future design of new NIR AIEgens. It also affords a novel NIR probe with high specific imaging ability to LDs.

The latter was purified by a short silica gel pad (eluent Hexane:AcOEt 8:2) to give the pure product 2,5-dibromo-3,6-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde as a yellow crystalline solid (203 mg, 46%). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 10.27 (s, 2H), 3.94 (s, 6H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 189.14, 156.23, 133.65, 119.48, 63.53.

Figure 6 shows a large absorption peak at 3180–3680 cm−1 in the IR spectrum, which is attributed to the alcohol hydroxyl group and multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups in naringin. The absorption peak at 3000–3300 cm−1 is attributed to the C-H stretching vibration of the benzene ring. The absorption peak at 2850–2950 cm−1 is attributed to the C-H bond stretching vibration of the saturated carbon in the structure. Generally, the carbonyl stretching vibration absorption peak of flavonoids is approximately 1650 cm−1, and the carbonyl stretching vibration absorption peak of dihydroflavonoids is approximately 1695 cm−1. However, the hydroxyl group at position 5 in naringin forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group, which reduces the frequency of the absorption peak. The carbonyl stretching vibration at position 4 in the final naringin appeared at 1647 cm−1, 1581 cm−1, 1518 cm−1, and 1447 cm−1, which is attributed to the C=C stretching vibration of the aromatic ring in the structure. The 1369 cm−1 and 1296 cm−1 peaks are attributed to the in-plane bending vibration of methylene in the structure. The multiple absorption peaks at 1208–1035 cm−1 are attributed to the C-O stretching vibration of aromatic ether and fatty ether bonds. The glycosidic bond absorption peak at 885 cm−1 indicates that the glycosidic bond is β-D-pyranoside, which is consistent with the structure of naringin. The absorption peak at 818 cm−1 is attributed to the C-H out-of-plane bending vibration of the B-ring aromatic ring para-substituted structure.  2.4.

The resulting mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 6 h. The mixture was then diluted with water (20 mL), and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL ×3). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (15 mL ×3), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. To a stirred solution of the resulting white solid (crude), 4-vinylpyridine (316 mg, 3.0 mmol), P(o-tol)3 (183 mg, 20 mol %), and triethylamine (1.2 mL, 8.7 mmol) in degaussed CH3CN under argon was added Pd(OAc)2 (69 mg, 10 mol %) quickly. The resulting mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 5 h. The mixture was then cooled to rt and diluted with water (30 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL ×3). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure.

However, when we treated (±)-rengyolone (3) with 1.0 M TBAF (2 equiv) in THF at room temperature, we obtained the dimeric product (±)-4 in 41% yield. The formation of dihydroxy dimerized RC product (±)-4 was confirmed by NMR spectra. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the olefin proton was observed at δ 6.75 ppm as a singlet, and the two hydroxy protons were observed at δ 5.60 (s, 1H) and 5.03 (s, 1H) ppm, respectively. In the 13C NMR, the two carbonyl groups appeared at δ 197.4 and δ 209.4 ppm, and the corresponding two olefinic carbons were observed at δ 135.7 and δ 148.5 ppm. The formation of the dihydroxy compound (±)-4 was also confirmed with a D2O shake experiment. When we added a drop of D2O to the 1H NMR sample, the peaks corresponding to the two hydroxy groups were completely absent at δ 5.60 (s, 1H) and 5.03 (s, 1H) ppm (Figure S1, Supporting Information File 1). The formation of the dihydroxy dimeric compound (±)-4 was further confirmed by HRMS, which showed a peak at 331.1150 corresponding to the C16H20O6Na [M + Na]+ ion. After some efforts, to our delight, we could obtain single crystals of (±)-4 using EtOAc as a solvent. Finally, the formation of heterodimerized dihydroxy RC product (±)-4 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis [16]. It is pertinent to mention here that in this reaction we obtained the heterochiral dimerized product (±)-4. We did not observe any homochiral dimerized product formation under TBAF reaction conditions. A plausible mechanism for the formation of heterochiral dimerized dihydroxy RC product (±)-4 through accelerated RC [6] is outlined in Scheme 4.

The formation of (±)-incarvilleatone (1), perhaps due to RC dimerized product (±)-4, first undergoes oxa-Michael followed by aldol reaction in one-pot. The aldol reaction take place with intermediate 5 in basic medium due to the close proximity of the two carbonyl groups. Finally, the structure of (±)-incarvilleatone (1) was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis [16]. We then undertook separation of both the enantiomers of (±)-incarvilleatone 1 (40 mg, Scheme 6) by HPLC using a Chiralpak IA analytical column with the mobile phase MeCN/H2O (70:30). HPLC on a chiral stationary phase resulted in the separation of enantiomers, (−)-incarvilleatone [(−)-1, 15 mg] and (+)-incarvilleatone [(+)-1, 14 mg]. The optical rotations of the individual enantiomers were recorded and compared with the ones of Zhang and co-workers [1] reported data and were found to be nearly the same, i.e., optical rotation of −13.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (isolated by Zhang and co-workers [1]) and −15.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (separated by us) for (−)-incarvilleatone [(−)-1]; and +17.3 (c 0.30, MeOH) (isolated by Zhang and co-workers [1]) and + 18.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (separated by us) for (+)-incarvilleatone [(+)-1]. We tried to crystallize both the enantiomers and after some efforts we could crystallize both the enantiomers using EtOAc as a solvent. The absolute configurations were assigned using single crystal X-ray analysis for (−)-incarvilleatone (−)-1 as 4R,5S,8S,9R,4'R,5'S,6'R,7'R,9'S and for (+)-incarvilleatone [(+)-1] as 4S,5R,8R,9S,4'S,5'R,6'S,7'S, 9'R (Scheme 6).

A plant specimen was authenticated by the Walai Rukhavej Botanical Research Institute, Mahasarakham University, Maha Sarakham, Thailand (Voucher No. S. Sedlak 19-1). The rhizomes were ground and dried to obtain an ethanolic crude extract (251 g). The extract was resuspended in methanol to yield a pale yellow methanol-insoluble solid (50 g). The obtained solid was further subjected to an open-column chromatography using silica gel (Arch.No. 7734, pore size 60 Å, particle size 70-230 mesh, Merck, USA) as an adsorbent. The column was eluted with a mixture of 40-80% dichloromethane-hexane under gradient separation. The fractions with similar patterns were combined based on thin-layer chromatography analysis and re-crystallized with methanol to yield pure forms of PB.

Villalgordo & Heimgartner, 1993 ▸) or the thio­amide 19 (cf. Bucher et al., 1995 ▸; Brun et al., 2002 ▸), respectively (Scheme 6). In the first case, starting with 2.50 g (7.9 mmol) of 18, azirine 12 was obtained in 70% yield (1.74 g) as a slightly yellow oil, which solidified under high vacuum (Gubler, 1996 ▸). In the second approach, the amide 18 was transformed into the thio­amide 19 in 94% yield, and 19.20 g (57.9 mmol) of the latter were treated with phosgene in DMF/CH2Cl2 and then with sodium azide in THF/DMF to give 11.05 g (61%) of azirine 12 as a yellowish solid.

The synthesis was envisioned to proceed through a double reductive amination from dialdehyde A using a small excess of the corresponding di- or triamines. To minimize the formation of larger ring sizes or polymers, the reaction was performed using a low concentration of dialdehyde A (55 mM) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and a syringe pump was employed to slowly add the amines over five hours (Scheme 2a). After stirring for 48 h, full conversion of dialdehyde A was obtained in all three cases, and the macrocyclic ligands could be obtained in 13–48% yield after purification. Complexes 1a–c were obtained by metalation of the respective ligands using Mn(CO)5Br in THF at 55 °C yielding the complexes as yellow solids in good yields (Scheme 2b). The complexes were analyzed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ATR-IR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Furthermore, the 1H NMR and 13C NMR chemical shifts of complex 1a were calculated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental values (Table S1).

The colourless solution was Schlenked 10×, then Pd/C (21 mg, 19 µmol, 11 mol%) was added. The atmosphere was exchanged to H2 via vacuum/H2 backfill (5×) and the mixture was heated to 323 K overnight. The next day another portion of Pd/C (37 mg, 35 µmol, 20 mol%) was added and the flask was purged with fresh H2. Then the reaction was again heated overnight. This was repeated twice, and after 4 d, NMR quench confirmed full conversion. The atmosphere was exchanged to argon by vacuum/argon backfill (5×) and the black suspension was filtered over silica. Compound (2) was obtained as a pale-yellow oil that solidified on standing in 89% yield (99 mg, 0.156 mmol).
