Uncontrolled use of antifungal drugs affects the development of resistance to existing drugs. Azole antifungals constitute a large part of antifungal therapy. Therefore, there is a need for new azole antifungals. Within the scope of this study, 17 new triazole derivative compounds were synthesized. Structure determinations were clarified by spectroscopic analysis methods (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HRMS). In addition, structure matching was completed using two-dimensional NMR techniques, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY. The antifungal effects of the compounds were evaluated on Candida strains by means of in vitro method. Compound 5d showed activity against Candida glabrata with a MIC90 = 2 μg/mL. Compound 5d showed activity against Candida krusei with a MIC90 = 2 μg/mL. This activity value, which is higher than fluconazole, is promising. In addition, the biofilm inhibition percentages of the compounds were calculated. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations performed with compound 5d are in harmony with activity studies.

This group of drugs is frequently used in the clinic. However, resistance to the drug, especially in long-term treatments, keeps the need for new azole antifungals constantly. Azole antifungals inhibit 14-α-demethylases enzyme and inhibit ergosterol synthesis necessary for fungal cell wall construction. The azole group heterocyclic ring is essential for its interaction with hemoglobin in the enzyme active site. This is exactly the purpose of the synthesis of new triazole derivatives within the scope of this study. In this study, 17 new triazole derivatives were synthesized. Structure determinations of the compounds were made using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS techniques. In addition, structure determination was validated for compound 5d using the 2D-NMR technique. In addition to the antifungal activities of the compounds, the percent biofilm inhibition values were tested on Candida strains by in vitro methods. As a result of activity studies, compound 5d exhibited a similar antifungal potential with fluconazole. It was even 8 times more active on C. krusei than fluconazole. This promising result has moved the study forward. The obtained in silico studies also confirm the activity studies. Molecular docking and then molecular dynamics studies were carried out as in silico studies. Dynamic studies showed that the interaction with hemoglobin iron, which is necessary for activity, is carried out from three points of our molecule. These structures are nitro substituent, triazole ring and phenyl ring. Especially the nitro group and the triazole ring showed a significant interaction rate. Therefore, the importance of both the triazole ring and the nitro substituent for the activity is clear. The bulky quinoxaline ring showed a continuous and strong interaction with the Tyr76 amino acid for 100 ns. Although this interaction may not be of primary importance for activity, it is thought to play an important role in maintaining the stability of the compound. In future studies, it is planned to develop the compound by keeping these structures constant.  4 Experimental Section [/INST]\n",
