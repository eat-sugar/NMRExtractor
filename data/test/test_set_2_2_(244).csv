PMC10052543,"Compound 2 was purified as a yellowish oil. Its molecular formula, C15H22O2, was established by positive HRESIMS (m/z 235.1694 [M + H]+, calculated 235.1693), with an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHDs) of five. The UV spectrum exhibited an absorption maximum of 235.7 nm (Figure S1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals for two double bonds, which included three hydrogen signals at δH 5.88 (1H, s), δH 5.72 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 1.0), and δH 5.56 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 1.0); three methylenes at δH 2.25 (2H, d, J = 11.0), δHa 1.92 (1H, m) and δHb 1.74 (1H, m) and at δHa 1.61 (1H, m) and δHb 1.40 (1H, m); and four methyls at δH 1.34 (3H, s), δH 1.28 (3H, s), δH 1.26 (3H, s), and δH 1.10 (3H, s) in the 1H NMR spectrum as well as active hydrogen signals at δH 4.55 (1H, s). The 13C-NMR and DEPT spectra (Table 1) showed carbon signals corresponding to the chemical units described above and confirmed their presence. These resonances included one ketone carbon (δC 206.8), three olefinic carbons (δC 135.1, δC 132.9, and δC 129.3), and three odd numbers, which indicated that δC 193.5 prefers one olefinic carbon, not to a ketone carbon; three quaternary carbons (δC 66.2, δC 44.9, and δC 41.4), three methines (δC 54.8, δC 35.3 and δC 34.3), and four methyl carbons (δC 29.9, δC 29.5, δC 29.4, and δC 28.5). In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 2), correlations of H-2 (δH 5.88) to C-4 (δC 44.9), C-5 (δC 54.8), and C-1 (δC 206.8) and from H-5 (δH 2.25) to C-1 (δC 206.8) and C-3 (δC 193.5), suggesting that a cyclopentenone (ring A) was formed by C-1, C-2 (δC 129.3), C-3, C-4, and C-5; a cyclohexene ring (ring B) formed by C-1′ (δC 41.4), C-2′ (δC 132.9), C-3′ (δC 135.1), C-4′ (δC 66.2), C-5′ (δC 35.3), and C-6′ (δC 34.3) was readily furnished by the 1H-1H COSY correlations (Figure 2) of H-2′ (δH 5.72)/H-3′ (δH 5.56) and H-5′ (δH 1.61, 1.40)/H-6′ (δH 1.92, 1.72), in combination with HMBC correlations of H-2′, H-3′, H-5′ (δH 1.61, 1.40) and H-6′ (δH 1.92, 1.74) to C-1′ and C-4′. HMBC correlations of H-6 (δH 1.34) and H-7 (δH 1.26) with C-3 and C-5, H-7′ (δH 1.28) with C-3 and C-2′, and H-8′ (δH 1.10) with C-3′ and C-5′, which indicated four methyl positions, as depicted in Figure 2, respectively. The relative configuration was further deduced from ROESY data (Figure 2). Key correlations between H-7′ and H-8′ suggested that H-7′ and H-8′ were on the same face of ring B. Therefore, a pair of enantiomers of 1′S′, 4′R′ was possible for the relative configuration of compound 2.

The evaporation of the organic layer gave a concentrated MeOH extract (143.5 g). The crude MeOH extract was partitioned between H2O and n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-BuOH, successively. The EtOAc soluble fraction (10 g) was fractionated by VLC on silica gel using a stepwise gradient of n- hexane-EtOAc 5% to yield eight fractions (I-P). Fraction L (1.38 g) was chromatographed by a silica gel column (n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 4:3:3) to give six fractions (L1–L6). The separation of subfraction L4 (324 mg) by a silica gel column with a stepwise gradient elution of n-hexane-EtOAc 5% gave three subfractions (L4.1–L4.3). Subfraction L4.3 (106 mg) was then purified by a silica gel column (n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 4.5:4:1.5) to yield 3 (9.8 mg).

PMC9951580,"For the synthesis of the ROS‐sensitive polymeric prodrug (Figure S1, Supporting Information), HO‐PEG2K‐Mal was acylated using OC and subsequently conjugated with LVT to obtain LVT‐PEG2K‐Mal. The results were validated by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Figure S2, S3 and Table S1,S2, Supporting Information). In addition, the protein 4.2 (P4.2), a cytoskeletal protein in RBC that consists of multiple fragments, has specific affinity for the intracellular domain of protein band 3, which is distributed in RBC membranes.[ 11 ] To further functionalize the polymeric prodrug to right‐side‐out orientated coupling on the inner leaflet of RBC cell membrane, we further reacted the cysteine terminated peptide sequence LFVRRGQPFTIILYC with LVT‐PEG2K‐Mal to obtain the functional polymeric prodrug (LVT‐PEG2K‐P) via Michael reaction between maleimide and sulfhydryl groups (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The results were successfully confirmed based on the matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF‐MS) (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

PMC9916977,"The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 1-1-4-3 showed two groups of resonance signals with a ratio of 2:1, which indicated that 1-1-4-3 was a mixture (Figures S9 and S10). Next, the two groups of high and low signals were analyzed. One secondary methyl (δH 1.22, d, (J = 6.9 Hz); δC 21.0 (CH3)), an oxygenated methine (δH 4.02, q, (J = 6.9 Hz); δC 66.3 (CH)) and one carbonyl (δC 176.9 (C)) were distinguished in the group with high signals in the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT spectra (Figures S11 and S12). The 1H–1H COSY correlation between the protons at δH 1.22 (H-3) and the proton at δH 4.02 (H-2) (Figure S13), as well as the HMBC correlations between H-3 and H-2 and the carbonyl (δC 176.9, C-1) (Figure S14), suggest that the secondary methyl, the oxygenated methine and the carbonyl were connected to form the structure of LA (Figure 4A). The quasimolecular ion peak at m/z 89.0244 (calcd. for C3H5O3− [M − H]− 89.0244) in the HR-ESI-MS further supported the presence of LA as a major constituent in 1-1-4-3. As for the low-signal group, the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT spectra displayed characteristic signals for two secondary methyls (δH 0.89 and 0.93, each d, (J = 7.0 Hz); δC 18.1 and 19.3 (each CH3)); two methines, including a nitrogenated one (δH 3.12, d, (J = 3.6 Hz); δC 59.9 (CH)); and a carbonyl (δC 170.0 (C)). As shown in Figure 4A, the observed 1H–1H COSY correlations between H-2′/H-3′ and H-3′/H-4′(H-5′) indicated the moiety of CH-2′–CH-3′(–CH3-5′)–CH3-4′, which was linked to the carbonyl (δC 170.0, C-1′) by the key HMBC correlation between H-2′ and C-1′. Therefore, the component with low content was determined to be valine, whose molecular weight was also consistent with the HR-ESI-MS ion peak at m/z 118.0863 (calcd. for C5H12NO2+ [M + H]+ 118.0863). In addition, the 1D NMR and HPLC analysis of the authentic samples, LA and valine, as well as an analysis of their mixture (LA and valine at a ratio of 2:1), were also performed. By comparing the 1D NMR data (Table 1 and Figures S15–S22) and HPLC spectra (Figure 4B–E) of 1-1-4-3 with those of LA, valine, and their mixture, it was further confirmed that 1-1-4-3 contained LA and valine.  2.5.

The overlayed PEGDE and blank chromatograms (TIC in Figure 1A) show that no other extra peak was identified.  PEGDE was also analyzed through pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) by using a multi-shot pyrolyzer. The first shot was performed at 300 °C, while the second one was performed at 600 °C, as reported in Figure 2. The temperatures chosen for the double-shot pyrolysis are based on standard conditions used for polymer analysis, as it is generally acknowledged that no reactions occur at 300 °C, except for the dehydration reaction, so it is possible to obtain an easy-to-interpret pyrogram that allows to identify any small polluting organic molecules, while decomposition products of the PEGDE oligomers can be observed at 600 °C.  The mass spectra of selected peaks of the pyrogram in the first and second shot are reported in Figure S1. All the peaks have similar mass spectra, no impurities or unexpected peaks were identified, the m/z ratios associated to each chromatographic peaks are the same both for the first and second shot, and all the ions can be associated to the fragmentation of the PEGDE chain, as explained in Figure 2 and Figure S3 (Supporting Information).

The molecular formula of 2 was determined as C20H20O9 with 11 unsaturated degrees by HRESIMS data at m/z 427.1004 (calcd. 427.1000 for C20H20O9Na, [M + Na]+), which was supported by the 13C NMR and DEPT spectral data. The IR spectrum of 2 featured typical absorption bands for hydroxyl (3446 cm−1) and conjugated ketone (1626 cm−1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 indicated two methyl groups (δH 2.09 and δH 2.18), two methoxy groups (δH 3.57 and δH 3.69), one methylene (δH 4.32, d, J = 12.1 Hz; 4.81 d, J = 12.1 Hz), two oxymethines (δH 5.65 and δH 6.76), and two hydroxyl protons (δH 8.92 and δH 11.46). The 13C NMR (Table 2) and DEPT spectra revealed 20 carbon atom signals, including one ketone carbonyl (δC 196.8), two oxygenated tertiary carbons (δC 89.9 and δC 70.3), two methoxy carbons (δC 60.3 and δC 60.0), one methylene (δC 55.8), two methyls (δC 11.0 and δC 10.3), and twelve olefinic quaternary carbons. Detailed analysis of 2D NMR spectra of 2 revealed that it had a similar structure to 1. The major differences in 2 were a hydroxymethylene group and a methoxy group substituted at C-12 and C-15, instead of the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group, respectively, when compared to 1 (Figure 2), which were further confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H2-18 (δH 4.32, 4.81) to C-11 (δC 108.3), C-12 (δC 132.1), and C-13 (δC 118.1), and from 15-OCH3 (δH 3.69) to C-15 (δC 134.6). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was elucidated as shown (Figure 1), named epicocconigrone D. The ROESY correlation between H-2 and H-10 indicated their cis orientation (Figure 2).

PMC10181127,"Choline acrylate (ChA) was obtained according to the procedure described in reference [40], which included two stages. Succinctly, the synthesis consisted of two ion exchange reactions, which were carried out in a thermostatically controlled vessel at 0 °C. At the first stage, choline hydroxide (ChOH) was obtained by mixing 15.245 g of ChCl and 30 wt% KOH solution in methanol. In the second stage, the ChOH solution was mixed with 8.656 g of acrylic acid (AA) (taken in a small excess). The residual ChCl content in ChA was evaluated using the gravimetric method by carefully collecting, drying and weighing the KCl obtained at the first stage. It was found that the yield of KCl was 98 wt%. Thus, the content of unreacted ChCl can be estimated as 1.6 wt%. Further, methanol was distilled from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C and reduced pressure. After the removal of methanol, the temperature was raised to 70 °C to remove excess AA. As a result, a white gel-like liquid was obtained. The chemical structure of the synthesized ChA was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy using the NMR Fourier spectrometer AVANCE II-500WB (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). D2O was used as a solvent.

PMC9880004,"The preparation process of Nano-reshaper was shown in Fig. 2a. In brief, a drug-loaded calcium phosphate core was synthesized using the reversed-phase microemulsion method, and the resultant precipitate was then combined with additional lipids in chloroform to form a thin film under high vacuum. After that, 5% glucose (Glu) solution was added to hydrate lipid film to obtain Nano-reshaper. ApoE-CaCP (without pLIGHT) and ApoE-pLIGHT@CaP (without CP) were synthesized using the identical procedure, with the exception of the different components in cores. Since the inner calcium phosphate cores were precipitated via the phosphate group’s interaction with calcium ions46, it was challenging to encapsulate and formulate lipophilic CBD for systemic delivery. Thus, we phosphorylated CBD via the hydroxyl groups to maximize loading efficiency (LE) by precipitating with calcium to form an amorphous core (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The obtained CP was confirmed by mass spectrum, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (Supplementary Figs. 1b, c and 2–4).

DHA is an antimalarial drug and has been reported to exert anticancer activities against various cancers but a short half-life limits further clinical applications. In this study, we found that UDCMe-Z-DHA, a hybrid of UDCMe and DHA via a triazole linkage, was ~23 times and ~4 times more potent than DHA in HepG2 cells and Huh-7 cells, respectively, in part due to increased stability.

PMC9933128,"The glycosidic bond configuration and molecular structure of the RSG7 EPS were further defined with one-dimensional (1H, 13C, and DEPT135) and two-dimensional (1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C HSQC, and 1H-13C HMBC) NMR spectroscopy. According to the 1H NMR of RSG7 EPS (Figure 3A), the anomeric region and ring proton region were detected at the signals of δ 4.5–5.5 and δ 3.1–4.5 ppm, respectively (Kavitake et al., 2016). The anomeric proton signal at 4.90 ppm was assigned to α-(1→6) glycosidic linkage, which was consistent with the FT-IR result at the absorption peak of 1,018.96 cm–1 (Figure 2). While the anomeric proton signal at 5.24 ppm was attributed to the presence of α-(1→3) glycosidic linkage in the RSG7 EPS (Li et al., 2022). However, the extensive overlapping of the peaks in the ring proton region due to the shielding effects of hydroxyl groups in the EPS resulted in difficulties in the attribution of each signal, and a two-dimensional NMR should be carried out to distinguish the signals. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 3B), the anomeric carbon region was presented at δ 95–110 ppm and the ring carbon region at δ 50–85 ppm (Wang et al., 2019b). The typical peaks at 97.72 and 99.30 ppm corresponded to signals in the anomeric region of 1H NMR. According to these results, the anomeric carbon signals at 97.72 and 99.30 ppm and the anomeric region at 4.90 and 5.24 ppm were assigned to C1 (Figure 3B) and H1 (Figure 3A) in glucosyl residues, respectively. Meanwhile, peaks in the 77–85 ppm illustrated the presence of branched linkage in the RSG7 EPS (Kavitake et al., 2016). In addition, carbon resonances at 73.38, 71.38, 70.06, 69.50, 65.51, and 60.31 ppm were attributed to the C2–C6 in the glucosyl residues. Further analysis based on 13C NMR and DEPT135 spectrum suggested that peaks of 65.51 and 60.31 ppm were both assigned to the C6 in glucosyl residues, and the C6 of the former peak involved in the formation of glycosidic bonds, while the latter was unsubstituted in the RSG7 EPS.

PMC9822446,"The UV spectrum of compound 2 recorded on-line during HPLC analysis exhibited λmax values at 242 nm, 300 nm (sh) and 326 nm, which is in accordance with an aromatic compound with a cinnamoyl type chromophore. The aromatic region of the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 (Figure S3) showed a 3H ABX system at δ 7.04 (d 2.0 Hz, H2), δ 6.99 (dd 8.2, 2.0 Hz, H6) and δ 6.75 (d 8.2 Hz, H5), a 2H AX system at δ 7.48 (d 15.9 Hz, H7) and δ 6.24 (d 15.9 Hz, H8), as well as to two phenolic hydroxyl protons at δ 9.59 (4-OH) and δ 9.13 (3-OH), in accordance with a caffeoyl moiety. This identification was confirmed by the observation of nine 13C signals assigned to this unit by the 2D 1H-13C HMBC spectrum and the 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of compound 2 (Table 1, Figures S4 and S5). The large coupling constant of 15.9 Hz observed for H7 and H8 confirmed the (E)-configuration of the double bond of the caffeoyl moiety. The crosspeaks at δ 4.11/166.4 (H1A’/C9) and δ 4.08/166.4 (H1B’/C9) revealed that the carboxyl of compound 2 was esterified with the γ-hydroxyl of a highly hydroxylated organic acid containing four carbons, which was identified as the methyl ester of threonic acid. A comparison between the relatively weak CD spectrum of compound 2 to that of commercially available L-threonic acid provided by Sigma Aldrich (Figure S16) revealed that both molecules exhibited a positive band around 195 nm and a negative band around 220 nm, indicating that the methyl threonyl moiety of compound 2 shares the same stereochemistry as that of L-threonic acid, which is synonymous with (2R,3S)-2,3,4-trihydroxybutanoic acid. Thus, compound 2 was identified as 4-Oxy-(E)-Caffeoyl-2′R,3′S-2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acid methyl ester (Figure 2). Moreover, the sample of compound 2 also contained a minor component, namely compund 3. The 1H and 13C signals belonging to compound 3 shared many similarities with that of compound 2, indicating that compound 3 is a structural isomer of compound 2, i.e., a caffeoyl derivative esterified with threonic acid (Table 1). The coupling constant observed between H7 and H8 (12.9 Hz) confirmed the identity of compound 3 to be 4-Oxy-(Z)-Caffeoyl-2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acid methyl ester (Figure 2).

The 1H NMR spectrum of AG showed six aromatic proton signals, three methoxyl signals, and one sugar moiety signal separately. Six proton signals upfield of δ 6.61–6.98 were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, which was characteristic of two 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring structures. In addition, there were three methoxyl signals at δ 3.69, 3.70, and 3.71 in the 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR spectrum of AG showed two carbonyl signals, twelve aromatic carbon signals, three methoxyl carbons signals, one anomeric carbon signal, and nine saturated carbon signals, separately. Thus, the aglycone of AG could be preliminarily determined as arctigenin based on the 1H NMR and 13C data and the comparison of literature. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra displayed one anomeric signal at δH 4.88 (d, J = 7.56 Hz) and δC 99.87, suggesting that there was one sugar moiety in AG. Further, the carbohydrate could easily be identified as β-d-glucuronic acid by negative mode ESI-MS fragments at m/z 371 [M-H-176]-, and TLC analysis of acidic hydrolysis of AG. The attachment sites of the carbohydrates in AG were determined as C-4′ by glycosylation, which was confirmed by HMBC analysis. Under further verification by DEPT 135, DEPT 90, HSQC, and HMBC spectrums, the structure of the derivative was elucidated as arctigenin-4′-O-glucuronide.

PMC9857212,"EL000327 is the crude extract from which B was isolated. This crude extract contained six compounds, including B and another highly cytotoxic compound, D. In our study, we compared the effect of our isolated compound on CRC cells with that of the crude extract, EL000327. Initiation of apoptosis upon treatment with EL000327 was detected by Hoechst staining, the incucyte apoptosis assay, and flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis. However, apoptotic markers were not clearly detected by western blot analysis at the same time points as B. Induction of cell cycle arrest, activation of autophagy, or the ROS/JNK pathway related proteins in Caco2 cells were also not observed upon treatment with EL000327. These results suggest that interactions between different compounds in the crude extract may alter the activity of EL000327. Alternatively, the effects of EL000327 and B may have been detected at different time points because EL000327 was either faster or slower to act than B.  5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a first-line treatment for many cancers, including CRC. 5-FU leads cells to death by preventing DNA replication and RNA synthesis through inhibition of cellular thymidylate synthase (TS) [46,47]. Combination treatments in which 5-FU is combined with different anticancer agents, enhance the anticancer effect and response rate of these treatments. Similarly, combination of B with 5-FU enhanced the cytotoxicity of B toward Caco2 and HCT116 cells at significantly lower treatment concentrations [48,49]. Combination of B and 5-FU induced apoptosis in Caco2 cells by enhancing the expression of cleaved caspase-3and PARP. Further investigations are required to understand the mechanism by which cytotoxicity is increased in the synergy between B and 5-FU. Furthermore, B exhibited excellent synergic effects with compound D. A combination of B and D induced apoptosis and autophagy in the Caco2 cells at comparatively low concentrations. These results provide evidence that B may act synergistically with a range of different anticancer agents to enhance their cytotoxic effect.  B is a novel naturally-derived compound, and this is the first study of the activity of B on CRC cells. We thoroughly investigated the mechanisms by which B induces apoptotic cell death and have laid the groundwork for a detailed analysis of the clinical usefulness of B. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the combination of B with known and novel anticancer agents may provide effective new treatment options for patients with CRC, which warrants further investigation.  5. Conclusions  The results of this study demonstrate that B induced caspase dependent apoptosis and autophagy in Caco2 cells via activating the ROS/JNK signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, B stabilized the microtubule dynamics and disrupted cell cycle progression by inducing G2/M phase arrest. Moreover, B exhibited synergism with known chemotherapeutic 5FU and novel compound D on the CRC cells.

PMC9965855,"The specimen of the sponge Clathria faviformis, analyzed in this study, was collected at 30 m depth by scuba diving along the coast of Riding Rock Point, in San Salvador, Bahamas, during a ship-based expedition in 2003. Once collected, the sponge was immediately frozen and kept at −20 °C until extraction. The frozen sponge (173.7 g wet weight) was chopped into small pieces and kept at −20 °C for 1h prior to lyophilization. After a 34 h lyophilization, the sponge (39.6 g dry weight) was extracted at room temperature with MeOH (3 × 0.7 L). The yellow colored MeOH extract was concentrated under a vacuum, until a volume of 500 mL of total extract remained. Then, 250 mL of H2O was added and the H2O-MeOH extract was concentrated under a vacuum reaching the volume of 500 mL. A second aliquot of 250 mL of H2O was added, and the extract was concentrated under a vacuum until 650 mL remained. The H2O-MeOH extract was first partitioned with H2O-saturated EtOAc. The resulting H2O layer was then partitioned with n-BuOH. The EtOAc (1.3 g) and n-BuOH (1.8 g) extracts were used for LC-MS/MS analysis. The EtOAc extract was chromatographed by normal-phase chromatography on a SiO2 column, using the elution step gradient n-hexane/EtOAc (1:1), n-hexane/EtOAc (2:8), 100% EtOAc, EtOAc/MeOH (9:1), EtOAc/MeOH (1:1), and 100% MeOH.

The 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC spectra revealed the presence of 20 carbons signals resulting from for one methoxy, one methyl, one methylene, eight methines, and nine quaternary carbons, including one lactonic ester group at δC 165.7 (C-9). The 1H-NMR data (Table 2) displayed characteristic resonances for four aromatic protons at δH 6.61 (d, J = 2.2 Hz, H-1), 7.00 (2H, m, H-11, and H-13), and 7.34 (d, J = 1.9 Hz, H-3), one methoxy group at δH 3.99 (s, H-15), one methyl group at δH 2.85 (s, H-14), one oxygenated methylene at δH 3.71 (m, H-5′), four oxygenated methines at δH 4.20 (2H), 4.31, and 5.80. The HMBC correlations (Figure 2) from H3-15 to C-2 and C-6; H3-14 to C-10, C-7, and C-11; H-13 to C-8 and C-11 suggested the presence of alternariol methyl ether in the chemical structure of 3 [27]. The NMR data (Table 2) of compound 3 were very similar to those of 8, except the existence of five more oxygenated carbons at δC 101.5 (C-1′), 73.1 (C-2′), 88.2 (C-3′), 70.8 (C-4′), and 62.9 (C-5′) in 3. Considering the molecular formula, it is speculated that there should be a monosaccharide structure in 3, which was further confirmed by the COSY correlations of H-1′/H-2′/H-3′/H-4′/H-5′ and HMBC correlations from H-1′ to C-2′, C-3′, and C-4′. The HMBC correlation of the anomeric proton at δH 5.80 (d, J = 4.3 Hz) with C-12 (δC 158.7) determined its linkage site in compound 3. The chemical shift of the anomeric carbon (δH 5.80 and δC 101.5) confirmed the α configuration. The sugar moiety was further determined as D-arabinoside by hydrolysis and compared to the standard.

PMC10004713,"Compound 2 was discovered as an amorphous and colorless powder. Referencing the NMR data and the HRTOFMS data results that showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 459.3844 [M+H]+ (calculated for C30H51O3 at m/z 459.3838), the molecular formula of 2 was established as C30H50O3, with six degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum exhibited hydroxyl (3443 cm–1), C-H stretching of aliphatic carbon (2939 cm–1), ketone (1702 cm–1), gem-dimethyl (1460 and 1386 cm–1), and ether (1040 cm–1) groups. The 13C NMR analysis with the aid of the DEPT and HSQC spectra of 2 (Table 1) showed the presence of a total of thirty carbon signals, which were assigned as eight methyls, nine methylenes, six methines (involving one olefinic and one oxygenated carbon), and seven quaternary carbons (including one olefinic and two oxygenated carbons), together with the aid of DEPT and HSQC spectra. The above data suggested that 2 is an onoceranoid-type triterpenoid [7]. The presence of one double-bond pair and one carbonyl ketone accounted for two degrees of unsaturation, leaving four degrees of unsaturation for the four-rings core of 2. In the 1H NMR spectrum, eight tertiary methyls at δH (ppm) 1.09 (3H, Me-23), 1.04 (3H, Me-24), 0.96 (3H, Me-25), 1.76 (3H, Me-26), 1.15 (3H, Me-27), 0.77 (3H, Me-28), 0.99 (3H, Me-29), and 0.75 (3H, Me-30), one olefinic methine at δH 5.40 ppm (2H, brs, H-7), and one oxygenated methine at δH 3.23 ppm (2H, dd, J = 11.5 and 4.0 Hz, H-21) were clearly identified. Detailed analysis of the 2D NMR spectra (1H-1H COSY and HMBC) (Figure 2) defined the structure of 2. The 1H-1H COSY showed correlations of H-1/H-2, H-6/H-7, H-15/H-16/H-17, and H-19/H-20/H-21, confirming an onoceranoid-type triterpene framework [7]. The presence of a ketonic group at C-3 and a hydroxyl methine group at C-21 was verified by the correlations between Me-23/Me-24 to C-3 and Me-29/Me-30 to C-21. Furthermore, the correlations of Me-27 to C-14 and Me-26 to C-7, C-8 revealed the attachment of a hydroxyl in the quaternary carbon at C-14 and the double-bond form at C-7/C-8. A careful analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR indicated that compound 2 was closely related to kokosanolide B [14], with the main difference being the hydroxyl moiety at C-21. The relative configuration of each stereocenter carbon in 2 was determined by an NOESY experiment. The NOESY spectrum showed correlations between H-21/H-17/H-3 and H-28/H-27. According to the biosynthesis of the onoceranoid-type triterpene, the orientation of H-17 is -oriented, which indicates that the H-21 proton has a orientation. Based on this result, it can be concluded that the hydroxyl group at C-21 is α-oriented, while the hydroxyl group at C-14 is -oriented. Thus, compound 2 was elucidated as a new onoceranoid-type triterpene, 14,21α-dihydroxy-onocera-7-en-3-one, and trivially named as kokosanolide F (2).","14,21α-dihydroxy-onocera-7-en-3-one",N/A,"In the 1H NMR spectrum, eight tertiary methyls at δH (ppm) 1.09 (3H, Me-23), 1.04 (3H, Me-24), 0.96 (3H, Me-25), 1.76 (3H, Me-26), 1.15 (3H, Me-27), 0.77 (3H, Me-28), 0.99 (3H, Me-29), and 0.75 (3H, Me-30), one olefinic methine at δH 5.40 ppm (2H, brs, H-7), and one oxygenated methine at δH 3.23 ppm (2H, dd, J = 11.5 and 4.0 Hz, H-21) were clearly identified.

These spectral data indicated that 2 was an analogue of vitexlactam A [13], except for the additional existence of an ethoxy moiety in 2. Further analysis of 2D-NMR spectra of 2 confirmed the assignment above. In the COSY spectrum, the correlation between H2-23 and H2-24 was observable. In the HMBC spectrum, there were long-range correlations from H2-15 to C-23, and from H2-23 to C-15/C-16 (Figure 2), which suggested that the ethoxy moiety was connected to the nitrogen atom. The relative configuration of 2 was determined to be the same as that of vitexlactam A via an observation of NOESY correlations (Figure 3). In the NOESY spectrum, there were cross-peaks between Me-20 and H-8/H2-11/Me-18, indicating they were α-cofacial, while H-5/H-6/Me-19/9-OH were β-cofacial. The absolute configuration of 2 was determined to be 5R/6S/8S/9S/10R via a comparison of its specific rotation [α]25D + 51.7 (c 2.1, MeOH) with that of vitexlactam A [α]25D−10.7 (c 0.42, CHCl3) [13], showing an opposite sign. Furthermore, a comparison of the calculated optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) spectrum of 2 tothe experimental one also supported that assignment, in which the calculated ORD spectrum of 5R,6S,8S,9S,10R of 2 agreed well with the experimental curve for 2 (Figure 6).

PMC10107673,"Given the intriguing reactivity of diborynes with monocyclic N‐heterocycle pyridine, we sought to expand our scope to bicyclic N‐heterocycle quinoline. The reaction of 2 with quinoline gave an inseparable mixture of products, however, treatment of 1 with quinoline resulted in an immediate color change from red to blue, similar to the above reaction of 2 with pyridine. 11B NMR spectroscopic resonances at 25 and 30 ppm were observed after a few minutes, suggesting the presence of diborene 6, analogous to 3. However, the resonance at 25 ppm had disappeared after 10 minutes, while the signal at ca. 30 ppm had broadened significantly. An additional color change to green occured within one hour, and a near‐complete decoloration took place overnight, the remaining light yellow solution suggesting the absence of diborene in the mixture. After workup by washing the dried reaction mixture with hexane and crystallization from a saturated hexane solution, the product was identified by SCXRD as the borylalkylideneborane 7 (Scheme 2), a constitutional isomer of the presumed intermediate 6 in which one of the carbene carbon atoms has exchanged with one boron atom.

PMC9921498,"To confirm that the fraction (C) is the BHET monomer, GC-MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, melting point, and DSC analysis were performed. As shown in Figure S3 (Supplementary Materials), it is clear from the mass spectrum of fraction (C) that the most significant characteristic peaks are intense (at m/z 211.1, 193.1, 149, 121.1, and 104) and are attributed to the BHET monomer as reported in the literature [14,35]. 13C NMR of faction (C) is shown in Figure S4 in which the signal at 167.18 ppm indicates carbon of the carbonyl group (–COO–), and signals at 135.44 and 130.68 ppm indicate aromatic carbon associated with carbonyl groups and hydrogen respectively. The signal at 67.96 ppm indicates the presence of carbon in the methylene group along the carbonyl group and the signal at 61.06 ppm represented the carbon in the methylene group neighboring to the hydroxyl group (–OH). 1H NMR of fraction (C) is shown in Figure S5 in which the signal at 8.17 ppm indicates aromatic hydrogen, and the signal at 4.85 ppm indicates hydrogen of the hydroxyl group (–OH). The signal at 4.41 ppm indicates the presence of hydrogen in the methylene group along the carbonyl group and the signal at 3.88 ppm represented the hydrogen in the methylene group neighboring to the hydroxyl group (–OH). The NMR spectrum confirms the BHET as the main product of PET glycolysis and is consistent with the reported literature [16,36,37,38].  The melting point of commercial and produced BHET as well as of PET residue was measured using a melting point analyzer. The operating conditions and corresponding results are given in Table S1. The commercial BHET starts to melt at around 103.1 °C and melts completely up to 107.4 °C. On the other hand, produced BHET starts to melt slightly later around 107.8 °C but melts completely around 111.7 °C. The melting point of unconverted PET residue was also measured and it was found that residue starts melting around 162 °C but melts completely around 168 °C corresponding to the dimer melting temperature range [38]. The melting point of BHET is in accordance as reported in various studies 109–110 [39], 111 [40] and 113.34 °C [41] via DSC-analysis. The melting point analysis is further supported by DSC analysis (Figure S5) which shows that PET residue comprises only monomer and dimer peaks. The small melting peak at 107 °C indicates the presence of BHET monomer and is likely the result of the monomer precipitating with the dimer instead of being dissolved by the water during filtration. Therefore, it is apparent that glycolysis comprises a monomer-dimer equilibrium, and no PET substrate is present in the residue [42,43]. To validate this further, a series of control experiments were performed, varying the reaction time to understand the degradation mechanism. In Figure S6, three main DSC peaks were observed around 110, 150–160, and 250 °C, which were attributed to trace amounts of BHET (not completely extracted), dimers of different compositions, and unconverted PET respectively [44]. It can also be observed in Figure S6, that the peak related to PET remarkably decreased with degradation time and is attributed to an increase in the depolymerization rate and eventually the formation of BHET monomer.",BHET,N/A,"1H NMR of fraction (C) is shown in Figure S5 in which the signal at 8.17 ppm indicates aromatic hydrogen, and the signal at 4.85 ppm indicates hydrogen of the hydroxyl group (–OH).

Figure 4g displays the 1H-NMR spectra of Ptriaz-CN and the Ptriaz-CN/metal ion complex in a H2O/DMSO-d6 mixture (v/v = 1:5) solvent. The proton signals of C3 and C5 in the 1,2,4-triazolium ring were clearly observed at 9.2 and 10.4 ppm, respectively. Upon the addition of Au3+, the C5-proton signal in the 1,2,4-triazolium ring disappeared, indicative of its reductive and coordinative interplay with Au3+.

Importantly, metal-carbene peaks were not observed in the 13C-NMR spectra for both Ptriaz-CN/(Pt2+ and Cu2+) complex solutions (Fig. S26).

The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra (Table 2, Figure S10) show 16 carbon signals, which were assigned as one methyl, four methylenes, five methines, and six non-protonated carbons (including 2 carbonyls and 1 carboxyl). These featured NMR signals are similar to those of canthaminomide F [11], suggesting that 2 is a 1-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl cantharimide-type derivative. The key difference is that the substitution of a methyl at C-1 is replaced by a hydroxymethyl, which is supported by the HMBC correlations of H2-10/C-2, C-6, and C-7 (Figure 2, Figure S12). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was assigned. The ROESY correlations between H-3 (δH 4.46), H2-10 (δH 3.69)/H3-11 (δH 1.24), and between H2-10 (δH 3.94)/H-6 (δH 4.36) suggested that 2 possesses the same relative configuration as compound 1 in the counterpart (Figure 3, Figure S14). The resolution of the configuration at C-1′ has been reported in previous literature [11], and the same method was used to determine the configuration of compound 2. The D or L-histidine was, respectively, submitted to a reaction containing compound 5 under 95% EtOH of solvent at 78 °C for 48 h, which led to the generation of 2a (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′R)/2b (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′S) (Supplementary Materials, Scheme S1). A careful comparison of the NMR data and the retention time in the HPLC chromatogram of 2a and 2b with those of compound 2 revealed that 2a is actually the same as 2 (Supplementary Materials, Figures S41–S45). Thus, the absolute configuration of 2 at C-1′ was assigned. With this information in hand, the absolute configurations at the rest chiral carbons of 2 were solved by comparison of the theoretical and experimental ECD spectra (Figure 4, Figure S16). The results showed that the calculated ECD spectrum of (1R,2R,3S,6R,1′R)-2 is in good accordance with that of 2.

In HMBC (Figure 4), the correlation between H-1′ [δH 4.78 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz)] with C-3 (δC 146.7) suggested one β-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-3 position of the aromatic cycle.

The aforementioned 1H and 13C NMR (Table 1) data which were similar to those of purpactin C′ (11) revealed that 1 could be a depsidone derivative (Chen et al. 2015). The main differences were the absence of the signals of an aldehyde and an acetyl in 1. Instead, it was found to be the presence of two methoxyls and a methine. The heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) correlations from H3-13 (δH 3.37) and H3-14 (δH 3.35) to C-10a (δC 98.8) confirmed the presence of a dimethyl acetal unit in 1 and the HMBC correlations from H-10a (δH 5.81) to C-5 (δC 124.8) and C-8a (δC 146.6) indicated the dimethyl acetal unit was at C-10a.

The chemical shift of H-1′ [δH 5.05 (dd, J = 9.2, 4.0 Hz)] in 1 implied the presence of a hydroxyl at C-1′ instead of 1′-acetyl group by combined analysis of its HRESIMS data.

As δH 4.89–5.53 ppm was the region of α-anomeric proton [30], combined with the characteristic signals of α-d-glucopyranose in the IR spectra, the residues were considered to have α-configurations.

In the spectrum, a series of signals from the benzoyloxy group at values between δH 7.54 and 8.04 was also clearly observed. Other overlapping signals centered between 1.05 and 2.06 ppm are attributed to resonance from either methine or methylene signals. Seven carbon signals corresponding to the benzoyloxy group were not present in the 13C NMR spectrum.

FTIR analyses of the isolated SNAPicillin product showed the emergence of several bands characteristic of the NO donor precursor, NAP, as well as N=O stretching vibrations characteristic of RSNOs (1497 cm–1). Further 1H NMR studies of the isolated SNAPicillin supported aminolysis of NAPTH with ampicillin’s amine via evidence of ring-opening and the presence of several distinct hydrogen environments associated with NAP’s amide group (labels 13 and 14) and its chiral center (label 10, see Figure 2C). 13C NMR studies further supported these findings, showing distinct carbon environment formation in the final isolated product (Figure S1).

For the third step, the bromination of alcohol 9 to generate 10, it was not possible to use the classical Appel bromination conditions (triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and CBr4 in dichloromethane) because they lead to the transformation of the carboxamide group of 9 to the corresponding nitrile 8.

Under the conditions deemed optimal for the bromination of a primary alcohol in the presence of a m-carbamoyl phenyl group [35], compound 10 was however obtained with a low yield of 26%.

PMC10254491,"The 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES (Figure S2) shows a complex spectral pattern, particularly in the aromatic region. We suggest that this is due to the structural complexity of DAPTES including asymmetric carbon atoms and bulky groups, which result in the possible coexistence of at least two isomers in the solution. The 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES was compared to that of SAPTES. The assignment of the signals for the two compounds is provided in the Materials and Methods section. A multiplet between 4.50 ppm and 4.23 ppm is seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES as proof of the formation of the -HNCH(Fur)P(O)- motif. The signal for the hydrogen from the imine -N=CH-group in SAPTES appears at 8.00 ppm, i.e., in the spectral region of the protons of DOPO. Therefore, it is not straightforward to conclude that this signal disappeared in the DAPTES spectrum due to its possible overlap with the DOPO resonances. However, it is clearly seen that the signal for the carbon atom from the imine group at about 152 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of SAPTES disappeared, and a doublet at 55.95 ppm with a coupling constant 1J{PC} = 115.17 Hz appeared in the 13C NMR spectrum of DAPTES (Figure S2) due to the newly formed aminophosphonate structure (–HNCH(Fur)P(O)–). Further evidence for the completion of the addition reaction is found in the comparison of the 1H and 31P{H} NMR spectra of DOPO and that of DAPTES. The doublet at 8.07 ppm (1J{PH} = 594 Hz) due to the P-H bond in the 1H NMR spectrum of DOPO (Figure S3) did not register in the 1H NMR spectrum of DAPTES as a consequence of the addition of the P-H bond from DOPO to the imine function of SAPTES. Secondly, the signal for the phosphorus atom in DOPO shifted downfield by 14 ppm in the 31P{H} NMR spectrum of DAPTES, as seen in Figure 1.

PMC10004635,"Compound 2 was deduced to have a molecular formula C15H18O6, the same as that of compound 1, as determined by HR-ESI-MS (m/z 329.0792 [M + Cl]−, calcd for C15H18O6Cl−, 329.0797). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed signals readily recognized for two methyl groups at δH 1.40 (3H, d, Me-13) and 1.19 (3H, s, Me-14), one olefinic methine at δH 7.81 (1H, H-5), and four oxymethines at δ H 3.07 (1H, dd, H-1), 4.88 (1H, dd, H-3), 5.33 (1H, H-6) and 4.57 (1H, ddd, H-8). The 13C NMR data (Table 1) supported the above analysis, which showed fifteen carbon signals including two methyls at δC 13.5 (C-13) and 20.6 (C-14), two methylenes, seven methines (including one olefinic methine at δC 147.8 (C-5) and four oxygenated methines at δC 60.2 (C-1), 65.8 (C-3), 81.8 (C-6), and 79.5 (C-8)), one oxygenated quaternary carbon at δC 58.5 (C-10), and two carboxyl carbon at δC 178.1 (C-12) and 172.6 (C-15). The closely resembled NMR spectral data (Table 1 and Table 2) of 2 with those of 1 supported 2 also being a germacrane sesquiterpene dilactone close to 1. Detailed comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra revealed that the signals for the hydroxy-methine group at C-2 and the methylene group at C-3 in 1 were replaced by signals for a new methylene group (δH 1.75 (1H, ddd, H-2α), 2.17 (1H, ddd, H-2β); δC 32.8 (C-2)) and a new oxymethine group (δH 4.88 (1H, dd, H-3); δC 65.8 (C-3)), respectively. This observation indicated the difference between the two compounds that the hydroxy group located at C-2 in 1 was changed to attach at C-3 in 2. The rationality for assigning the hydroxy group at C-3 in 2 was supported by observation of significant HMBC correlations from δH 7.81 (1H, H-5) to δC 65.8 (C-3) (Figure 3), and accurately interpreted the significant chemical shift change of C-4 and C-5 from δC 131.1 (C-4) and 151.4 (C-5) in 1 to δC 138.0 (C-4) and 147.8 (C-5) in 2, respectively. Furthermore, the β-orientation of the hydroxy group at C-3 was supported by the observed small coupling constants of H-3 with H-2 (JH-3α,H-2α = 4.0 Hz and JH-3α,H-2β = 2.2 Hz) [19] and further well evidenced by the NOESY spectrum, in which significant NOE correlations of H-3 with H2-2, but no NOE correlation of H-3 with H-1, were displayed (Figure 3). Moreover, compound 2 showed closely similar chemical shift values and proton coupling constants from C-6 through C-14 (Table 1 and Table 2) to those of 1, which indicated that the other part structure and relative configurations (from C-6 through C-14) of 2 was the same as that of 1.

PMC10221562,"In this study, we develop E. coli pDSY as a screening model to screen QSIs that inhibit the rhl system in P. aeruginosa. In addition, citrinin, an inhibitor of the QS system of P. aeruginosa, was isolated from the marine fungus Penicillium sp. JH1 found in the coastal waters of Qingdao (China). The inhibitory effect of citrinin on the production of rhamnolipid was better than that of elastase and pyocyanin. Compared with non-mucoid P. aeruginosa PAO1, citrinin inhibited the biofilm formation of mucoid P. aeruginosa FRD1 more significantly and therefore has the potential to treat clinical infections. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that citrinin significantly inhibited the transcription of las, rhl and pqs system-related genes. In addition, the results of heterologous expression in E. coli showed that citrinin had the strongest inhibitory effect on the las system. Molecular docking results showed that citrinin bound to PqsR and LasR with better affinity than the natural ligands. The present study is the first to report the anti-QS effect of citrinin.

PMC10056930,"Epicocconigrone C (1) was isolated as a yellow solid, and its molecular formula was determined to be C19H16O9 with 12 degrees of unsaturation by HRESIMS data at m/z 411.0698 (calcd. 411.0687 for C19H16O9Na, [M + Na]+), which was supported by the 13C NMR and DEPT spectral data. The IR spectrum of 1 featured typical absorption bands for hydroxyl (3413 cm−1) and conjugated ketone (1670 cm−1). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1 revealed two methyls (δH 2.26 and δH 2.31), one methoxy (δH 3.70), two oxymethines (δH 6.38 and δH 6.83), one aldehyde proton (δH 10.34), and one hydroxyl proton (δH 11.33). The 13C NMR (Table 2) and DEPT spectra showed 19 well-resolved carbon atom signals, including one ketone carbonyl (δC 196.9), one aldehydic carbonyl (δC 191.2), two oxygenated tertiary carbons (δC 89.8 and δC 68.6), one methoxy carbon (δC 60.2), two methyls (δC 11.8 and δC 10.2), and twelve olefinic quaternary carbons at δC 156.9−104.5, accounting for 8 degrees of unsaturation. Thus, compound 1 was thought to possess a tetracyclic skeleton. The strong heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) correlations from H-17 (δH 2.31) to C-12 (δC 121.7), C-13 (δC 121.9), and C-14 (δC 144.3), from H-18 (δH 10.34) to C-11 (δC 112.6), C-12, C-13, and C-14, as well as the weak signals from H-17 to C-11, C-15 (δC 138.4), and C-16 (δC 135.8) confirmed the existence of ring A (Figure 2). The HMBC correlations from H-19 (δH 2.26) to C-3 (δC 130.8), C-4 (δC 115.8), and C-5 (δC 156.9), as well as the HMBC correlations from 7-OH (δH 11.33) to C-6, C-7 (δC 153.6), and C-8 (δC 104.5) established the substitution of the aromatic ring D. Furthermore, the HMBC correlations from H-2 (δH 6.83) to C-10 (δC 68.6) and C-16, from H-10 (δH 6.38) to C-2 (δC 89.8), C-11, C-12 and C-16 suggested the presence of two oxygen bridges between C-16/C-2 and C-2/C-10 in ring B, which could be confirmed by the low field chemical shift signal of CH-2 (δC 89.8, δH 6.83). Ring C was established by the HMBC correlations from H-2 to C-4 and C-8, and from H-10 to C-8 and C-9 (δC 196.9). The comprehensive NMR analysis indicated that 1 shared the same oxygen-bridged skeleton with epicocconigrone A (4) [24], with the exception that the appearance of 6-OCH3 in 1 replaced 6-OH in 4, which was supported by the HMBC correlation from 6-OCH3 (δH 3.70) to C-6 (δC 134.7). Thus, the planar structure of 1 was elucidated as shown (Figure 1), named epicocconigrone C. In the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum of 1, the correlation between H-2 and H-10 was indicative of their cis relationship (Figure 2). The absolute configuration of 1 was confirmed by the ECD calculation.

Furthermore, from the 13C NMR spectrum, 14 index of hydrogens deficiency in molecule 1 were detected.

This obtained profile suggested the presence of a lignan derivative [19]. On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of 11 aromatic protons attributable to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic rings and one benzoic acid. Homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (H-1H COSY) and 1D Total Correlation Spectroscopy (1D-TOCSY) experiments showed correlations between H-2/H-6, H-2′/H-6′, H-2″/H-6″, H-7/H-9′, H-7/H-7′. The connectivity of each proton to the respective carbon was confirmed in the heteronuclear-single-quantum-coherence (HSQC) spectrum, while 13C NMR data assignments (Table 1) were made, using a heteronuclear-multiple-bond-correlation (HMBC) experiment. The HMBC correlations between the signal of H-2″, H-6″, and H-9′ and the signal at 167.8 ppm (C-7″) indicated benzoic acid esterification at C-9′. Analysis of the 2D NMR spectra, especially the HMBC data, confirmed that 1 was a lignan with a similar structure to agastinol [19], with the only difference being the presence of benzoic acid which was esterified at C-9′ in 1 instead of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in agastinol.

PMC10224992,"To obtain a water-soluble reactive additive, we synthesised Cur-Na by chemically modifying curcumin using sodium bicarbonate, where the H+ of phenolic hydroxyl of curcumin molecular was substituted by Na+ (red ellipses in Fig. 1a). Meanwhile, the carbonyl bond in curcumin underwent keto-enol tautomerism due to the hydroxyl group in methanol, forming a new C=C double bond (blue ellipses in Fig. 1a). Such modifications were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic resonance of the phenolic hydroxyl group (δ = 9.65 ppm) has disappeared by adding sodium to curcumin, indicating the substitution of H+. The formation of the C=C double bond was evidenced by the changes in the alkene signal (δ = 5.93 ppm), where a new signal peak representing the trisubstituted alkene was developed (Fig. 1b). The full spectrum of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR are available in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The existence of Na was determined by the 23Na-NMR spectrum (see Supplementary Fig. 3). The molecular weight measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is 434, identical to that of the structural formula (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). The synthetic Cur-Na is a multifunctional additive that can be incorporated into bioink to improve printing quality. To verify its suitability for light-based 3D bioprinting, the light absorbance and water solubility were initially assessed experimentally. As shown in the absorbance spectra (Supplementary Fig. 5), Cur-Na demonstrated excellent light attenuation capability due to the absorbance peak (~425 nm) near 405 nm, a wavelength commonly used in light-based 3D bioprinting owing to its low detrimental effects on cells compared with UV light (e.g., 365 nm)37,38. Thus, Cur-Na can be used as a photoabsorber to effectively prevent over-curing layers, improving vertical printing resolution. In addition, Cur-Na has a water solubility of as large as 51 mg mL−1, making it well-suited for formulating water-containing bioink. Solution with low-concentration biomaterials (e.g., PEGDA and GelMA) and high water content is favourable for bioprinting because of the high bio-performance and good fluidity34,35. When Cur-Na monomers are dissolved in such a diluted bioink, the reactive functional groups (three C=C double bonds of alkene) can participate in the chain-growth reaction, offering extra controllability to the fundamental polymerisation process. Such a mechanism is of great importance in improving printing quality, which will be explained in detail in the section of photoinhibiting mechanism.Fig. 1 Synthesis of curcumin-Na.",Cur-Na,N/A,"Such modifications were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), the characteristic resonance of the phenolic hydroxyl group (δ = 9.65 ppm) has disappeared by adding sodium to curcumin, indicating the substitution of H+.

During the reaction, an intermediate form with an amide bond undergoes intramolecular self-cyclisation to create a spirolactam functional group in the structure of I-R6G, in which an amide group bonds to the C9 atom of the xanthene conjugate group of I-R6G by nucleophilic attack [40,41,42], leading to the formation of a bulky heterocyclic aromatic structure. The recrystallised I-R6G exhibited the expected structural features (including molecular structure, weight and elemental composition), as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton/carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H- and 13C-NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and elemental analysis (EA) (see Supporting Information for more detail, Figures S1–S4 and Table S1). In addition, single-crystal X-ray diffraction clearly revealed that the crystal structure of I-R6G exists as a locked spirolactam moiety (Figure 1a). The spirolactam moiety is positioned almost orthogonally to the plane of the xanthene moiety in I-R6G, indicating a stable spatial arrangement between the spirolactam and xanthene moieties. Details of the crystal data and structure refinement for I-R6G are summarised in Figure 1b and the Supplementary Crystallographic Information File. After confirming the chemical structure of I-R6G, the solubility of I-R6G in different aqueous solutions and organic solvents was evaluated in order to explore the effect of introducing the imidazole and spirolactam moieties on the solubility of R6G. As shown in Figure 1c,d, I-R6G was highly soluble in common organic solvents and also displayed unique fluorescence under a long wavelength ultraviolet (UV) lamp. However, I-R6G was very difficult to dissolve in water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), even after the solution was heated to 60 °C for 1 day, suggesting that the presence of the imidazole and spirolactam moieties in the molecular structure of I-R6G profoundly affect its solubility and amphiphilic properties compared to water-soluble pristine R6G. Similar trends in the solubility of I-R6G were also observed in ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As presented in Figure S5, I-R6G in organic solvents exhibited clear absorption and florescence peaks, but did not exhibit any characteristic UV-Vis and PL peaks in water or PBS, further confirming that I-R6G is hydrophobic and is highly soluble in a wide range of polar and non-polar organic solvents, i.e., R6G reacted with 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole was fully converted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Therefore, this intriguing finding motivated our inquisitiveness to explore the environmental-responsive behaviour of I-R6G in aqueous solution.",I-R6G,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,36839677,Pharmaceutics. 2023 Jan 20; 15(2):354,Pharmaceutics,2023.0,CC BY,2023-02-27 23:25:18,no

PMC10143840,"Inhibitor 6: For the 17β-HSD3 inhibitor 6, the basic nucleus is E1 (17-C=O), unlike that of E2 (17β-OH) used for the other inhibitors and the activator. The comparison of 13C NMR data (Table 2) for C and D-rings is, therefore, in agreement with those reported in the literature for E1 [43]. A functionalized side chain linked at position C-3 of the steroid by an amide bond influences the chemical shifts of the A-ring signals, mainly in 13C NMR. Thus, deshielding effects are observed on the carbons in ortho (C-2/+13.3 ppm and C-4/+12.0 ppm) and para (C-10/+6.0 ppm), as well as a shielding effect on the carbon carrying the chain (C-3/−13.3 ppm) compared to the data of C-1 to C-5 and C-10 of E2 (Table 1). The presence of the o-trifluoromethylphenylsulfonamide-trans-dimethylpiperazinoamide chain is confirmed by the appearance of several characteristic but complex signals, except for the carbonyl (C-1′) of the amide at 171.5 ppm. Thus, due to the presence of amide and sulfonamide bonds, as well as possible conformations, the substituted piperazine ring gives rise to several signals between 40.5 and 50.0 ppm (CH2 and CH) and 15.8 and 14.4/14.6 ppm (CH3) in 13C NMR, as well as broad signals between 3.30 and 4.90 ppm (CH2, CH) and 1.06 and 1.19 ppm (CH3) in 1H NMR.

PMC10074073,"Two key factors that influence the in vivo fluorescence performance of small organic molecule dyes are solvent‐ and aggregation‐induced fluorescence quenching due to different interactions with highly polar water molecules. Since the discovery of the first NIR‐II dyes, synthetic chemists have primarily focused on designing new molecules with optimal in vivo fluorescence performance and imaging function.[ 24 , 25 , 30 ] The S‐D‐A‐D‐S system incorporates appropriate features to reduce both solvent‐ and aggregation‐induced fluorescence quenchings.[ 33 , 34 , 36 ] For example, in the design of IR‐FEP,[ 33 ] one of the best performers in this series, using 3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as the donor unit afforded a conformational distortion of the conjugated backbone, thereby limiting aggregation‐induced quenching. Alkyl chains on the fluorene shielding unit stretch out of the plane of the conjugated backbone, further limiting the propensity of the molecule to aggregate while also serving as a solvent shield for the core. We adapted this scaffold as the basis for our molecular design in which EDOT and benzobisthiadiazole were maintained as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. To improve the shielding effect of the unit, the alkyl chains on the fluorene were extended from six to eight carbon atoms each. We also appended to each of the fluorene‐shielding units, an N,N‐dialkylaniline moiety bearing functionalized C11 chains as anchors to the solubilizing moieties. Molecular dynamics studies on dilute solutions of sucrose suggest the existence of two hydration shells between the solute and the bulk solvent.[ 37 , 38 ] The first hydration shell spans 2.8–3.7 Å from the solute hydroxyl oxygens, with strong radial water structuring. This structuring is stabilized by inter‐ and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between water and solute hydroxy groups, with each hydroxyl group surrounded by 3.9 to 4.4 nearest neighbors, indicating saturated hydrogen bonding capacity. At the limit of the first hydration shell (3.7 Å), the water density is estimated to decrease to a little more than half of the bulk water density. The second hydration shell has a long‐range structure with a center of 5.5 Å. Taken together, both hydration shells form a substantial shielding effect between the core of the solute and the surrounding bulk water molecules. We reasoned that this shielding phenomenon can be adapted to the S‐D‐A‐D‐S system. The PEGylated variant of the molecule CPK‐03‐37 was accessed in eight linear synthetic steps (Scheme S1.1, Supporting Information). To access the sucrose derivative XW‐03‐66, 6f‐azido sucrose was synthesized in five linear synthetic steps and appended to the core structure using click chemistry (Schemes S1.2 and S1.3, Supporting Information).

PMC10179066,"In order to confirm the molecular structure of extracted melanin, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR) analysis can be carried out. Melanin is generally dissolved in a deuterated solvent such as deuterium oxide/sodium deuteroxide (D2O/NaOD) [110,111] or dimethylsulfoxide-D6 (DMSO-D6) [112,113]. There are several chemical shifts in the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra of melanin that can support the correct identification of melanin molecular structures [44]. As an example, characteristic 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained for the intracellular melanin extracted from Lachnum singerianum YM296 mycelium [114]. In the 1H-NMR spectra, the chemical shifts between 6 and 8 ppm were attributed to the aromatic hydrogens of indole and/or pyrrole rings. The observed peaks between 3.2 and 4.2 ppm were caused by the methyl or methylene groups attached to nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms. The presence of an NH-group linked to indole was attributed to the signals within the range of 1.3–2.5 ppm. In the 13C-NMR spectra, the peaks between 160 and 185 ppm were typically ascribed to the carbon atoms in carboxyl groups or the carbonyl groups of peptidic bonds [111].

The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2), coupled with HSQC analysis, showed resonances for fifteen carbons (4×C, 7×CH, 2×CH2, 2×CH3), in which two lactone carboxyl carbons, four oxymethines, one oxygenated quaternary carbon, one olefinic methine, and one olefinic quaternary carbon were deduced. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum showed correlations of H-1/H-2/H2-3, H-5/H-6, and H2-9/H-8/H-7/H-11/H3-13, indicating the presence of structural fragments of C-1–C-2–C-3, C-5–C-6 and C-9–C-8–C-7–C-11–C-13 (Figure 2). In the HMBC spectrum, the observation of 1H−13C long-range correlation signals from δH 7.79 (1H, H-5) to 32.2 (C-3) and 174.3 (C-15), and from δH 2.58 (1H, H-3β) to δC 174.3 (C-15) supported the connections of C-4 with C-3, C-5, and C-15. The HMBC correlations from δH 5.27 (1H, H-6) to 79.2 (C-8) and 41.4 (C-11), and from δH 2.62 (1H, H-7) to δC 151.4 (C-5), 79.2 (C-8) and 13.5 (C-13) supported the connections of C-7 with C-6, C-8, and C-11.

The HMBC correlations from δH 1.40 (1H, H-13) to 178.0 (C-12) supported C-11 linked with the carboxyl carbon C-12. The HMBC correlations from H-6 to C-15 and from δH 4.64 (1H, H-8) to C-12 supported the ester bond linkages of C-6 with C-15 and of C-8 with C-12, respectively. Those above spectral data and literature precedents supported 1 to be a germacrane sesquiterpene dilactone [19,24]. Careful comparison indicated that the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 1 closely resembled those of a previously reported known germacrane sesquiterpenoid 1,10-epoxy-4-germacrene-12,8;15,6-diolide [16], except that the resonances for the methylene group at C-2 in the known compound were absent in 1. Instead, additional signals for an oxygenated methine group [δH 3.73 (1H, H-2); δC 66.9 (C-2)] were exhibited in the spectra. This observation supported that the structure of 1, as shown in Figure 1, was close to 1,10-epoxy-4-germacrene-12,8;15,6-diolide with the only difference that one more hydroxy group attached at C-2 in 1. This deduction was in complete accord with the molecular formula of 1 and the β-orientation of the hydroxy group at C-2 was supported by the observed large coupling constant of H-1 with H-2 (JH-1β,H-2α = 11.7 Hz) [19]. Moreover, the β-orientation of the 2-hydroxy group was further well evidenced by the NOESY spectrum, in which significant NOE correlation signals of H-2 with Me-14, but not H-2 with H-1β, were observed (Figure 3).

PMC9962809,"To further elucidate the structure of PCA, the NMR spectra of dsPCA was analyzed. In the 1H NMR spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2A), six signals of anomeric proton occurred at 4.49, 5.07, 5.13, 5.19, 5.24 and 5.25 ppm. The signals of anomeric carbon appeared at 97.96, 98.28, 105.02, 109.43 and 110.76 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2B). According to the result of methylation analysis, it could be deduced that the anomeric carbon signals at 109.43 and 110.76 ppm were likely signals of α-linked arabinofuranose unit [19]. The 1H NMR spin systems of dsPCA were further assigned by the 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC spectra (Figure S2C,D). The H-1 of A at 4.49 ppm was related to the C-1 at 105.02 ppm, and the H-1 of D at 5.19 ppm was related to the C-1 at 98.28 ppm. The H-4/C-4 of A and H-6/C-6 of D were at 4.20/77.82 ppm and 3.70/65.12 ppm, respectively. Therefore, A was →4)-β-d-Galp-(1→ unit and D was →6)-α-d-Galp-(1→ unit. The H-1 of B at 5.07 ppm was related to the C-1 at 109.43 ppm. B was attributed to →2,5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ residue because of the down-field chemical shifts of C-2 at 84.30 ppm and C-5 at 71.05 ppm. The H-1 of C at 5.13 ppm was correlated to the C-1 at 97.96 ppm. The H-1 of E at 5.24 ppm was related to the C-1 at 110.76 ppm. E was assigned to →5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ residue because of the down-field chemical shifts of C-5 at 71.05 ppm. The H-4/C-of C4 was at 4.10/76.97 ppm, thus C was ascribed to →4)-β-l-Arap-(1→ unit. Compared with →4)-β-l-Arap-(1→ residue, the C-2 shift of F changed to low displacement above 75.86 ppm which represented F and was →2,4)-β-l- Arap-(1→ unit. By combining the data from the 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC spectra, the assignment of the main proton and carbon signals of the six sugar residues could be completed (Table 2).  The 1H–13C HMBC spectrum of dsPCA (Figure S2E) gave the linkage sequences of various glycosidic units. The corresponding signals H-1 (C)/C-4 (C,F) showed the sequences [→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→] and [→4)-β-l-Arap-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→]. The related signal H-5 (B)/C-1 (E) indicated the linkage [→2,5)-α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→]. The cross signal H-1 (D)/C-2 (F) confirmed the fragment [→6)-α-d-Galp-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→]. Moreover, the related signals H-2 (F)/C-1(E) confirmed the linkage [→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→2,4)-β-l-Arap-(1→].

PMC10056982,"In conclusion, this study described a new bazzanane-type sesquiterpenoid, marinobazzanan (1), from the genus Acremonium. This is the first Acremonium-derived bazzanane-type sesquiterpenoid isolated with chemical-structure modifications, such as chlorination and amination. Marinobazzanan (1) was shown to inhibit cancer-cell migration and invasion at non-toxic concentrations of 1, 2.5, and 5 µM and downregulate the transcription factors Snail, Slug, and Twist. In addition, marinobazzanan (1) decreased cell motility by downregulating the expression level of KITENIN while upregulating that of KAI1. Furthermore, the new compound modulated the expression of β-catenin by downregulating downstream target genes. Marinobazzanan (1) was also shown to have a reduced number of metastatic nodules in an intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model. Together, these findings suggest that 1 exhibits potent anticancer activity against cancer cells in vitro and anti-cancer activity for the peritoneal carcinomatosis model in vivo.

PMC10005096,"We first considered the leaving moiety of the probe since small biomolecules had a limited lifetime in biological system, which called for cleaved groups with excellent electron-withdrawing ability to translate biomarkers into optical signals rapidly. Given that, the first choice of masking group was 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfonyl group (DNBS), which has often been chosen as the responsive unit for biothiols [48,49,50,51]. Therefore, by modifying the hydroxyl group in the fluorophore, we envisioned that the fluorescence could be totally quenched through blocking intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, thus minimizing background fluorescence interference. Then, by covalently connecting DNBS to fluorophore, we designed and constructed Cy-DNBS. The reaction of biothiols and Cy-DNBS generated Cy-OH and thereby restored the strong absorption and emission at 726 nm, 762 nm, respectively. The detailed synthetic route and recognition mechanism were shown in Scheme 1.

Among all tested compounds, (+)-elatol (1) was the most active compound against trophozoites of Naegleria fowleri, strains ATCC 30808™ and ATCC 30215™, with IC50 values of 1.08 μM and 1.14 μM, respectively. The activity of (+)-elatol (1) against the resistant stage of N. fowleri was also assessed, showing great cysticidal properties with a very similar IC50 value (1.14 µM) to the one obtained for the trophozoite stage. Its enantiomer (−)-elatol (2) was also analyzed, showing to be 34-fold less potent with an IC50 of 36.77 μM and 38.03 μM, thus revealing that spatial disposition is crucial for the anti-Naegleria activity. Additionally, the structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis suggests that dehalogenation leads to a significant decrease of activity. The lipophilic character of these compounds, such as (+)-elatol (1) (log P 3.65), confers them as good chemical scaffolds to develop new drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier.  6.

PMC9960386,"To evaluate the successful synthesis of the PBSu and its biocomposites, NMR spectra were obtained. The chemical structure of the produced aliphatic polyesters was assessed by proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Scheme 1 presents the numbered structures of the studied polymers. The part of the structure corresponding to carbons 1â€“4 appears basically at the same shifts for all samples and the assigned chemical shift in 1H and 13C remain at approximately the same positions (Figure 2). The 1H-NMR spectra of PBSu and its biocomposites are shown in Figure 2a. The 1H-NMR resonance signal of pure PBSu appears at 2.62 ppm and gives a single peak, which is associated with the methylene protons (2) in the succinic moiety. The resonances at 1.71 and 4.11 ppm are respectively assigned to the methylene protons (4) and (3) in the 1,4-butanediol unit. Figure 2b depicts the 13C NMR spectra of the synthesized polymers. As mentioned above, the peaks of all samples corresponding to carbons 1â€“4 remain basically the same. At 172.2 ppm, the deprotected carbons of the carbonyls (1) are recorded, and at 28.9 ppm, the carbons (2) of the methylene groups. The carbons that are adjacent to the oxygen atom of the ester bond (3) give a peak at 64.1 ppm, while the other methylene carbons of the aliphatic chains (4) appear at 25.1 ppm. Thus, the NMR spectra demonstrated successful synthesis of the PBSu and PBSu/BC biocomposites. The results are in accordance with the literature [33,34].  The XRD pattern of PBSu and its biocomposites is presented in Figure 3.

These peaks are also observed in biocomposites while BC is completely amorphous. The addition, the BC does not affect the crystal form of PBSu. No shift of the PBSu peaks is observed, indicating that the unit cells of the polyester and the BC remain the same.

PMC10096449,"Further analysis of NOE interactions also inferred that compounds 2 and 3 are diastereomers of pseudolycorine. As can be seen in Figure 2, spatial proximities were observed for H-1, H-2 and H-10b in the NOESY spectrum, indicating that these three hydrogens are on the same side of the plane. H-1 and H-2 appeared as two broad singlets with no noticeable splitting, suggesting a cis-orientation. In addition, H-10b and H-4a shared a J-coupling of 11.1 Hz, typical for the trans-orientation between these two hydrogens reported for the lycorine-type scaffold as mentioned above [27]. Therefore, combining NOE correlations and J-coupling information, it can be deduced that H-1, H-2 and H-10b were on the same side and were on the opposite side of H-4a. Among the three remaining possibilities as discussed above, the SRSS is the sole configuration that can show all these NOESY correlations. Hence, the relative configuration of compounds 2 and 3 was established as (1S,2R,4aS,10bS)-pseudolycorine, or its enantiomer. The structures of compounds 2 and 3 were elucidated with the configuration of one chiral center (at position H-2) differing from the configuration reported for pseudolycorine, and thus, correspond to 2-epi-pseudolycorine. To be noticed, C-4 was not observed in CD3OD, whereas it could be observed in (CD3)2SO in both HMBC and 13C-NMR spectra. Table 4 shows NMR data of compounds 2 and 3 in CD3OD and (CD3)2SO.  As reported in Table 3, the experimental optical rotation of 2-epi-pseudolycorine (compounds 2 and 3) was only −8.0 and was significantly different from the computed values, ranging from 227.9 to 230.6, if dextrorotatory, and from −230.4 to −227.7, if levorotatory. Based on these data, it was not possible to deduce the absolute configuration of compounds 2 and 3. At this point, it was hypothesized that the sample consisted of a racemic mixture. The fact that the measured value is not 0, but −8, could be caused by the presence of some impurities and/or the measurement or weighing errors due to the small amount of material. In order to determine whether the sample consisted of a racemate, an enantioseparation was performed, and the obtained HPLC chromatogram of the mixture of compounds 2 and 3 indeed showed two peaks with almost equal peak areas (Figure S20). Hence, the mixture of compounds 2 and 3 was confirmed to be a racemate. Compounds 2 and 3, occurring as an enantiomeric mixture, were reported for the first time and the name 2-epi-pseudolycorine was adopted. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrum of compounds 2 and 3 in (CD3)2SO was devoid of any signal, confirming the existence of a racemic mixture (Figure S23). Finally, the assignment of (−)-2-epi-pseudolycorine (2) to the configuration (1S, 2R, 4aS, 10bS) and (+)-2-epi-pseudolycorine (3) to the configuration (1R, 2S, 4aR, 10bR) was made according to their simulated optical rotations (see Table 3).",2-epi-pseudolycorine,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,37049986,Molecules. 2023 Apr 4; 28(7):3222,Molecules,2023.0,CC BY,2023-04-17 23:24:44,no

In acetone-d6, two broad signals at δ 6.28 (H-6) and 6.48 (H-8) were detected and the two doublet A2X2 aromatic system protons at δ 7.13 (H-3′,5′) and 7.91 (H-2′,6′), J = 8.7 Hz, typical of a kaempferol residue. The presence of the anomeric proton at δ 5.83 (H-1″, brs), the methine protons at δ 5.62 (H-2, brs), 4.20 (H-3, dd, J = 9.7 and 3.0 Hz), 4.98 (H-4, t, J = 9.7 Hz), 3.39 (dd, J = 9.7 and 6.1 Hz) and the secondary methyl group at δ 0.86 (H-6, d, J = 6.1 Hz) suggested the presence of an α-rhamnopyranoside moiety substituted in position H-2″ and H-4″ by two p-coumaroyl residues, as observed from their typical signals. In particular, the signals of the double bonds H-2′′′ and H-3′′′ at δ 6.44 and 7.68 (J = 16.0 Hz) and H-2′′′′ and H-3′′′′at δ 6.31 and 7.56 (J = 16.1 Hz) revealed the presence of two E-configured double bounds. COSY spectrum (Supplementary Figures S7 and S8) confirmed the connections around the rhamnopyranoside and the positions of the p-coumaroyl residues at H-2″ and H-4″of the sugar residue for the downfield shifts showed by these protons. Through an extensive study of 2D 13C NMR spectra (HSQC and HMBC), the chemical shifts were assigned to all the carbons and protons (Supplementary Figures S10–S13). In this way, compound 3 was identified as kaempferol-3-O-α-L-(2″,4″-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnopyranoside as previously reported [25,26,27,28]. The identification was also supported by the data collected by the electrospray ionization (ESI) MS spectrum, which showed the protonated [M + H]+ ion at m/z 725.","kaempferol-3-O-α-L-(2″,4″-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnopyranoside",N/A,"In particular, the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3 was recorded in acetone-d6 [25] and in CD3OD.

PMC10083354,"2P-Pt was characterized by analytical methods, infrared (IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR characteristics of the complex is consistent with those reported for related Pt(II) complexes (Pazderski et al., 2009). Structural elucidation is depicted in the experimental section. Signals in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra ( Figure 3 ) were observed with the expected chemical shifts and assignment was performed based on 2D-1H 13C HSQC spectra. The presence of a multiplet around 7.1 ppm and at 125–150 ppm in the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra, respectively, confirmed the presence of the p-cymene moiety. The pyrazol rings exhibit one set of resonance for the protons and carbons H4, Me3 and Me5, indicating that the pyrazole rings are equivalent ( Figure 3 ). The results are consistent with a square plane geometry for the platinum centre, with the ligand coordinated in a κ 2-NN bidentate fashion. 195NMR spectrum of 2P-Pt revealed one signal around -2300 ppm which correspond to the region expected for the coordination of two chlorine and two nitrogen atoms to the metal. The IR spectra of 2P-Pt exhibited C–N stretching bands in the range of 1000 cm−1 attributed to the pyrazol rings and it was identified new bands at around 1461–1394 cm−1 due to the C=C aromatic stretching vibrations of the p-cymene moiety (Michelin et al., 2011). The 3000 cm−1 region showed absorptions attributed to C\H stretching of CH2 and CH3. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of 2P-Pt was recorded in a DMSO solution (10-5 M) at 25°C. The absorption maximum of the 2P ligand moves hyperchromically to 212 nm after metalation. This strong band may refer to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions between π-orbitals on Cl to d-orbitals of platinum. The stability of the new compound was tested in CDCl3 by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the compound were unchanged after three days in solution at room temperature. As it happens to many metallodrugs, the platinum compounds needed to be dissolved in a mixture of H2O:DMSO to perform biological assays which in any case did not exceed 0.25% v/v of DMSO. Therefore, the stability of the 2P-Pt in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6:D2O was carried out by NMR monitoring. The set of signals belonging to the starting complex persist throughout the stability experiments carried out in both experiments. The existence of only one pattern for 2P-Pt suggests ruling out fast chloride dissociation.

Production of SAG by B. amyloliquefaciens FJ18 in a nonaqueous phase has been previously described [18]. B. licheniformis WNJ02 (CCTCC NO:M2018394) was adaptively domesticated by B. amyloliquefaciens FJ18. WNJ02 was glycosylated with the 7-phenolic hydroxyl group of apigenin to form apigenin-7-O-β-(6″-O)-d-glucoside, and the 6-hydroxyl group of the glucose group in AG was succinylated to form SAG. The conversion rate of apigenin to SAG by WNJ02 was 94.2%. The reaction schema is shown in Figure 1a. High-resolution ESI-MS of the SAG product (Figure S1) detected a molecular ion [M+H] + with a mass of 533.13, with apigenin at m/z 271.06, presumably linking a glucose and a succinyl group at different sites to obtain m/z 533.13 and m/z 534.13, indicating an empirical formula of C25H24O13.

The formation of (±)-incarvilleatone (1), perhaps due to RC dimerized product (±)-4, first undergoes oxa-Michael followed by aldol reaction in one-pot. The aldol reaction take place with intermediate 5 in basic medium due to the close proximity of the two carbonyl groups. Finally, the structure of (±)-incarvilleatone (1) was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis [16]. We then undertook separation of both the enantiomers of (±)-incarvilleatone 1 (40 mg, Scheme 6) by HPLC using a Chiralpak IA analytical column with the mobile phase MeCN/H2O (70:30). HPLC on a chiral stationary phase resulted in the separation of enantiomers, (−)-incarvilleatone [(−)-1, 15 mg] and (+)-incarvilleatone [(+)-1, 14 mg]. The optical rotations of the individual enantiomers were recorded and compared with the ones of Zhang and co-workers [1] reported data and were found to be nearly the same, i.e., optical rotation of −13.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (isolated by Zhang and co-workers [1]) and −15.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (separated by us) for (−)-incarvilleatone [(−)-1]; and +17.3 (c 0.30, MeOH) (isolated by Zhang and co-workers [1]) and + 18.0 (c 0.30, MeOH) (separated by us) for (+)-incarvilleatone [(+)-1].

Cross-peaks from H-9 to C-7/8/11 were observed in the HMBC spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting a 4-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-7-thiazolyl-picolinamide moiety. Lastly, the 4-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-7-thiazolyl-pyridinecarboxamide moiety and the alkyl chain were found to be attached at the C11 position, based on the key HMBC correlation from H-1′ to C11/C-9/C-8 (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy that the assignment of compound 1 was confounded by the lack of clear HMBC correlations, largely due to the high fraction of quaternary carbons and heteroatoms. Fortunately, however, the crystal structure of the also isolated compound 7 enabled unambiguous structural confirmation of the karnamicins by analogy (Fig. 1b). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of co-isolated 2–6 also showed high similarity to those of 1 and 7, except for alkyl side chain substitutions (Fig. 1b). Their structures were then determined based on extensive analyses of spectroscopic data (Supplementary Tables 2–6 and Supplementary Figs. 7–37).

PMC9964336,"The newly isolated compounds alongside suberitenones A (10) and B (11) were assessed for their ability to inhibit RSV gene expression and their effect on the cell viability (Table 3). Neosuberitenone (1) was the only compound that did not show any viral inhibitory effects at 25 µg/mL (6, 8, and 9 were not tested due to a lack of sample supply), suggesting that the ring D must be appended by a single bond to result in activity. Suberitenones A and B demonstrated the strongest antiviral potential of the tested compounds, with IC50 values of 7.9 and 3.5 µM, respectively, while suberitenone F (3) was also active (IC50 = 9.8 µM). The other isolated compounds had IC50 values ranging from 10.9–20.5 µM (Table S12), therefore suggesting that oxidation about ring C and removing the enone double bond of ring D are not likely to be alterations that would result in an increase in activity for future structure–activity relationship studies. The CC50 values were ~4–5 fold higher than the IC50 values for the newly isolated compounds (Table 3). Suberitenone B (11) showed the highest activity and greatest selectivity index.  Suberites sp. compounds were also submitted to a broad range of infectious disease screening. No antibacterial activity was detected against the ESKAPE pathogens, nor antifungal activity against several Candida strains. The cytotoxicity was assayed against the murine macrophage J774 cell line, where no significant activity (EC50 below 10 µM) was observed for any compound. Taken with low cytotoxicity, the selectivity of suberitenones A and B (10, 11) for RSV among other infectious diseases is noteworthy.  3. Materials and Methods  3.1. General Experimental Procedures  Optical rotations were measured using an AutoPol IV polarimeter at 589 nm. UV/Vis spectra were extracted from HPLC chromatograms. NMR spectra were acquired using either a Varian Inova 500 spectrophotometer or a Varian 600 MHz broadband spectrophotometer. The residual solvent peak was used as an internal chemical shift reference (CD3OD: δC 49.0; δH 3.31, CDCl3: δC 77.0; δH 7.26). High-resolution mass spectrometry−liquid chromatography data were obtained on an Agilent 6540 QTOF LCMS with electrospray ionization detection.

All of the solvents used for column chromatography were of HPLC grade, and H2O was distilled. Solvent mixtures are reported as % v/v unless otherwise stated.  3.2. Biological Material, Extraction and Isolation  Sponge specimens were collected in the austral fall, 2018, within a 3.5 km radius of Palmer Station, Antarctica (64° 46.50’ S; 64° 03.30’ W). The frozen sponge was freeze-dried (1.35 kg wet weight and 200 g dry weight) and then crushed by hand before being extracted in MeOH (1.6 L) twice overnight. The extracts were combined, were then passed through an HP20 column (250 mL), pre-equilibrated in H2O, and combined following elution. The eluent was then diluted with an equal volume of H2O and passed back through the column twice, followed by a 750 mL H2O wash. The column was then eluted with 750 mL portions of (1) 75% Me2CO/H2O and (2) Me2CO (fractions A1 and A2, respectively). Fraction A1 (5 g) was then reconstituted in MeOH (25 mL), filtered, and fractionated generating fractions (B1–B25) by repeated preparative C18 HPLC (9 mL/min) using the following method: 70% can/H2O (0.1% CH2O2) for 6 min, a linear gradient to 100% ACN over 8 min, and 100% ACN isocratic for 11 mins. Fraction B25 contained suberitenone A (~500 mg), while fraction B23 contained suberitenone B (~250 mg).

According to a previous report, Ad-NC was synthesized directly from adamantanol in one step. The synthesis of Ad-NC was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

PMC10197080,"The 1H and 13C ssNMR spectroscopy was used to additionally directly investigate the structural features of PANI-UiO-66 and PANI-UiO-66-NH2 composites in comparison with the pristine components. Experimental 1H VF/MAS NMR and 13C ssNMR (VF/MAS and CP/MAS for PANI and MOFs, respectively) spectra of pristine materials (Figure 8a,c,e) were attributed based on the literature data67−69 and supported the proposed structures (Figure 8, middle panel). New signals, marked as HPANI, were observed in the 1H VF/MAS NMR spectra (Figure 8b,d right-hand panel), confirming the incorporation of PANI into MOFs in PANI-MOF composites. Moreover, the comparison of 1H VF/MAS NMR spectra of pristine MOFs and PANI-MOF composites, clearly indicates that Zr–OH groups interact with PANI chains. It could be attributed to the participation of MOF in the protonation of PANI, which agrees with the vibrational spectroscopy data, showing increased protonation of PANI in the composites compared to that in the pristine polymer, synthesized in the absence of MOFs. The corresponding 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra show that PANI in the PANI-MOF composites can be partially hydrolyzed,70 which is manifested by new carbonyl signals at ca. 173.5 ppm. Furthermore, according to a comparison of NMR patterns in Figure 8 (left-hand panel), 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra also indicate different behavior of PANI in the composites with different MOFs. In the case of PANI-UiO-66, the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum shows a significant broadening of the detected signals and a noticeable shift of the peak corresponding to −CH< aromatic carbons. The broadening of the NMR signals indicates immobilization of the respective moieties, and the change in position of the −CH< aromatic carbons peak suggests that they are involved in physical interaction. On the contrary, in the case of PANI-UiO-66-NH2, a broad −CH< signal, corresponding to PANI, overlaps the signals of aromatic carbons of the UiO-66-NH2 template. Moreover, the almost missing signal at 150.5 ppm (marked C1) clearly indicates that −NH2 groups, present in pristine UiO-66-NH2, are affected by the polymerization of aniline, which can likely be attributed to the grafting of PANI chains to the UiO-66-NH2 skeleton.

The catalytic performance was tested in an H-type cell using 20 mL of 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 0.2 mmol cyclohexanone and 2 mmol NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve shows an enhanced current density after the addition of cyclohexanone and NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 5). After 4000 s of electrolysis at different potentials, the products were analysed and quantified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry (GC‒MS), and gas chromatography (GC). Interestingly, cyclohexanone oxime was identified as the only organic product. All the peaks at 2.4, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.5 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 2) and 160.7, 32.1, 26.8, 25.7, 25.5, and 24.4 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 3) match well with the cyclohexanone oxime standard sample. Additionally, the molecular weight of 113.1 given by GC‒MS further confirms the successful synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). A 92% yield, 99% selectivity (in terms of C), 26% FE, and 0.165 mmol h−1 cm−2 formation rate of cyclohexanone oxime are obtained at the optimum potential of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and NH4+ is the major byproduct (Fig. 2d, e, Supplementary Figs. 9–12 and Supplementary Note 4). The performance is better than that of the pure Cu catalyst (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14 and Supplementary Note 5). Then, the reaction process is monitored (Fig. 2f). Cyclohexanone is consumed completely within 4000 s, and the yield of cyclohexanone oxime shows an opposite tendency compared to cyclohexanone. Then, a preliminary techno-economic analysis (TEA) on plant-gate levelized cost per tonne of cyclohexanone oxime was performed (Supplementary Note 6). The electrosynthesis strategy is much more profitable at the optimum condition of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a given electricity price of 10 cents kWh−1 (the price of electricity generated from renewable sources is 3 cents kWh−1) (Fig. 2g)24, showing the industrial application potential of this electrosynthesis strategy. Notably, 10-fold molar equivalents of NaNO2 were used to realize the rapid synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, and the cost should be further decreased by improving the utilization of NaNO2 (Supplementary Fig. 15). Subsequently, the durability of the catalyst was assessed, and the performance and catalyst structure were well maintained during 50 cyclic tests, showing the good stability of the Cu-S catalyst (Fig. 2h) (Supplementary Figs. 16, 17).Fig. 2 Performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis over a Cu-S cathode.",cyclohexanone oxime,O/N=C1CCCCC/1,"All the peaks at 2.4, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.5 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum","160.7, 32.1, 26.8, 25.7, 25.5, and 24.4 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum",N/A,"2.4, 2.1, 1.6, 1.5",N/A,"160.7, 32.1, 26.8, 25.7, 25.5, 24.4",37236928,Nat Commun. 2023 May 26; 14:3057,Nat Commun,2023.0,CC BY,2023-06-03 23:22:25,no

The allocation of C-5 and C-6 at δ ppm 72.97 and 63.52 respectively was the final confirmation of the presence of 5β, 6β-epoxy moiety. The δ-lactone side chain became evident from the characteristic signals at δ ppm 1.73 and 1.62 each integrated for 3H (two olefinic methyls, H-27, H-28 respectively) and a multiplet at δ ppm 4.62 (H-22). Moreover, the 13C NMR data displayed one carbonyl carbon (δ C 166.78), and two olefinic carbons (δ C 154.48 and 119.9) characteristic for the δ-lactone side chain. The downfield shift appearances of H-21 methyl at δ ppm 1.24 as a singlet signal with the absence of H-20; indicate the presence of an oxygen function at C-20. The presence of a γ-lactone carbonyl deduced from the presence of a carbonyl signal at δ ppm 175.26; together with the absence of 18-methyl in 13C NMR data suggest the presence of γ-lactone like that of the withaphysalins [36].

PMC10180428,"Geldana acid B (2), colorless oil, was assigned a molecular formula of C11H20O4 based on the HR-ESI-MS [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 239.1249 (calculated for C11H20O4Na, 239.1254), corresponding to two degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum of 2 showed absorption bands for hydroxy (3397 cm−1) and carbonyl (1708 cm−1) groups. The 13C-NMR and DEPT spectra revealed the presence of eleven carbon resonances ascribable to two methyls, three methylenes, five methines (two oxygenated at δC 71.8 and 78.3, and two olefinic at δC 131.8 and 137.8), and one carbonyl at δC 178.5. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2, signals ascribable to one methyl triplet, one methyl doublet, two oxygenated methine protons, and two olefinic protons could be well distinguished. The above-mentioned information suggested the existence of one di-substituted double bond and one carbonyl in 2, accounting for both the two degrees of unsaturation implied by the molecular formula. This deduction proposed that 2 was a chain carboxylic acid derivative. The structure of 2 was established by the detailed elucidation of the 2D-NMR spectra (Figure 2). In the 1H-1H COSY plots, the correlations of H3-9 (δH 1.12)/H-8 (δH 3.60), H-8 (δH 3.60)/H-7 (δH 3.81), H-7 (δH 3.81)/H-6 (δH 5.48), H-6 (δH 5.48)/H-5 (δH 5.46), H-5 (δH 5.46)/H-4, H-4/H2-10, H2-10/H3-11 (δH 0.90), and H2-2/H2-3 indicated the presence of two structural fragments in 2, namely CH3(9)-CH(8)-CH(7)-CH(6)-CH(5)-CH(4)-CH2(10)-CH3(11) and CH2(2)-CH2(3). The connection of CH2(3) and CH(4) was supported by the HMBC correlations from H2-3 to C-4 and C-5, as well as from H2-2 to C-4, in spite of the absence of 1H-1H COSY correlation between H2-3 and H-4. Additional HMBC correlations from H2-2 and H2-3 to the carbonyl anchored a carboxyl group at C-2. The chemical shifts of C-7 and C-8 in combination with the molecular formula suggested that both C-7 and C-8 were substituted by hydroxy groups for the α,β-unsaturated diol moiety in 2. A relatively large coupling constant (15.5 Hz) between H-5 and H-6 revealed the E configuration of the double bond. In order to determine the relative configuration of the vicinal diol, we tried to prepare the acetonide derivative of 2 by chemical derivatization. Unfortunately, it turned out to be futile by furnishing several products which were difficult to be separated, probably due to the instability of 2 under the reaction condition. Hence, the configuration of C-4, C-7, and C-8 in 2 remained undefined. Compound 2 was proposed to be biosynthesized via a PKS pathway incorporating a rare extender unit ethylmalonyl CoA.  2.2.

A total of 3 mg of dried PBSR1 was dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methylated with 1 mL of CH3I, which was slowly added, lasting 8 h under N2 protection. Then, the solution was extracted with chloroform and the distilled water was evaporated. This operation was repeated until the absorption peak in the O-H region (3000–3500 cm−1) of the IR spectrum disappeared. Afterward, the resulting PBSR1 was continuedly reacted with TFA (4 mL, 2 mol/L) at 110 °C for 3 h followed by reduction with NaBH4 to produce the acetylated product. The analysis was performed by an Agilent 7890A/5975C instrument with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 mm) (Thermo Co., Austin, TX, USA).

PMC9867338,"In addition to the assignment of the hydrogen atoms, the assignment of the carbon atoms of the structure of ThBr was also carried out and shown in the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S2), from which it is evident that the number of signals of the carbon atoms, 10 in number, corresponded to their number in the structure of the compound. Moreover, the values of the chemical shifts corresponded to the characteristic shifts of the carbon in the chemical environment, so the shift at position 9 corresponded to the characteristic shift of the O=C-C-X bond; the shift at position 2 corresponded to the shift associated with the Ar-C bond; the shift at positions 1, 3, and 5 corresponded to the shift associated with the C=C bond; the shift at position 7 corresponded to the shift of the C-O bond; and the shifts at positions 6, 10, 12, and 13 corresponded to the shifts of the C-C bond seen in the structure of ThBr.  Figure 10 shows the 1H NMR spectra of all obtained PEDOT-Br macroinitiator products with different monomer ratios. To determine the real ratios and their difference from the ratio of monomers in the reaction setup, integrals of known protons belonging to specific groups of individual monomers were used (shown in the Supplementary Materials). For this purpose, a signal numbered 13 and 14 corresponding to the protons of two equal CH3 groups of the ThBr molecule and a signal numbered 8, 23, 24 corresponding to the protons present in the two CH2 groups of the EDOT molecule and one CH2 group of the ThBr molecule were used. If we assume that the integral of signal 13, 14 is equal to 6 because it corresponds to six protons from the two CH3 groups of the ThBr molecule, then we can easily determine the EDOT content in each sample from the magnitude of the integral of the signal labelled 8, 23, 24 [25]. Such a calculation yielded the ratios shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the ratios obtained agreed quite well with the original ratios, although it was obvious that a slightly higher proportion of EDOT monomers than specified was present in all samples. It can be concluded that EDOT reacts more readily and rapidly during polymerization than ThBr itself. In addition, the appearance of the double signals seen in all products with more ThBr monomer (TE 1:1–TE 1:0.2) and in the 1H NMR of PThBr (Figure S12) indicates that the aliphatic chains of the ThBr monomer were randomly oriented in space and that the polymers were atactic. The signal at 1.56 ppm could be assigned to water present in CDCl3, which is used as an NMR solvent [43].",PEDOT-Br,N/A,Figure 10 shows the 1H NMR spectra of all obtained PEDOT-Br macroinitiator products with different monomer ratios,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,36679137,Polymers (Basel). 2023 Jan 4; 15(2):253,Polymers (Basel),2023.0,CC BY,2023-01-24 23:34:50,no
PMC10180202,"In this paper, the metabolic profiles of DMU-212 in ApcMin/+ mice’s serum, liver, colorectal tissues and intestinal contents were systematically and comprehensively investigated based on the effectiveness of the medicine. A total of 63 DMU-212 metabolites were determined and summarized through quick, sensitive and accurate UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/LTQ MS combined with the data processing software “Compound Discoverer 3.3” and the AcquireXTM data acquisition workflow. In addition, further verification of the representative active metabolites was employed using molecular docking analysis. The Phase I metabolites of DMU-212 were mainly produced via demethylation, oxidation, desaturation, dehydration, reduction and hydration, while the major Phase II metabolites were methylation, acetylation, glucuronide, cysteine, glycine and glutamine conjugation products. As a result of this study, a simple method for studying drugs’ metabolism in vivo is provided, as is scientific and reliable support for a complete understanding of DMU-212’s metabolism and transformation. In addition, as a reference for the further development of new drugs, this is also important for a deeper understanding of the active constituents of DMU-212 and its action mechanisms for CRA prevention.
