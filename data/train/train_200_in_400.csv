PMC10091418,"To a cold (0 °C) solution of 1 (347 mg, 0.236 mmol) in methanol (20 mL), stirring under dinitrogen flow, oxalyl chloride (320 mg, 217 μL, 2.53 mmol) was added slowly. The Schlenk vessel was closed with a septum with a needle—to allow the evolution of CO and CO2 during the reaction. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. After the reaction was completed (the “milky” solution changes to transparent), the solvent was evaporated. The resulting solid was washed three times with distilled water and dried in vacuo.

PMC6255260,"3.5. Isolation of chysoeriol-7-O-rutinoside by preparative liquid chromatography Air dried plant material (500 g) was extracted with 1500 ml of methanol at 60 °C. Filtrated extract was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 200 ml of methanol-water (1:1, v/v). Chlorophyll was removed by extraction with chloroform. Purified extract was evaporated under reduced pressure until methanol is removed. The water layer was partitioned against ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was again partitioned against water. This water extract was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in methanol and applied on silica gel 60, 20 x 20 cm, 1.0 mm thin layer TLC plates as a 15 cm band. The plate was developed using 100:25:10:10:11 (v/v/v/v/v) ethyl acetate-dichloromethane-formic acid-acetic acid-water The chromatographic band (RF=0.13) expected to contain the compound was scraped off and extracted with methanol. To purify the compound, preparative liquid chromatography was done once more using ethyl acetate-methanol-formic acid-water (100:13.5:2.5:10, v/v/v/v) as mobile phase and the same stationary phase. Purified compound (RF=0.25) was again extracted with methanol, filtered through 0.45 µm filter, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol and checked for purity by HPLC-DAD-MS.

Derivatization of monosaccharides was realized according to Pierre et al. [31,32], dissolving the lyophilizate in pyridine and Sylon (BSTFA/TMCS; 99%/1%). The mix was incubated at room temperature 2 h and under Argon to form trimethylsilyl-O-glycosides which were solubilized in dichloromethane after evaporation of reagent. The samples were injected on an Agilent 6890 Series GC System coupled to an Agilent 5973 Network, equipped with an OPTIMA-1MS column (Macherey-Nagel; 30 m, 0.32 mm, 0.25 Âµm) from Machereyâ€“Nagel with a helium flow rate of 2.3 mL/min. The first time, temperature was at 100 Â°C for 3 min. In a second step an increment of 8 Â°C/min up to 200 Â°C for 1 min was applied before a final increment of 5 Â°C/min up to 250 Â°C. Electronic Impact (EI, 70 eV) ionization method was performed with the trap temperature set at 150 Â°C and the target ion was fixed at 40â€“800 m/z. The relative molar proportions were calculated using area normalization method. As monosaccharides standards, Ara, Rha, Gal, Glc, Xyl, Man, GlcA and GalA were prepared and analyzed following the same procedure.  2.6.

PMC8162098,"The amphiphilic long-tail pH probe CS-1 was designed to allow the mapping of pH levels in different organelles in cancer cells. Its synthesis is summarized in Scheme 1. Briefly, CS-1 was synthesized in six successive steps. First, compound 2 was obtained from A in two steps in good yield. Separately, 8-bromonaphthalic anhydride was reacted with ethylene diamine to give compound 3.40 Compound 3 was subject to N-alkylation with tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide intermediate 4. Reaction of 4 with 2 yielded compound 5. Finally, the tert-butyl group present in 5 was deprotected by treatment with TFA giving the desired long-tail amphiphilic pH probe, CS-1. Two reference compounds, R1 and R2, were prepared so as to explore the role of the amino centres labelled as N (a′/b′) in controlling the putative pH-dependent fluorescence response. The synthesis of compounds 1–7, CS-1, R1, and R2 is described in the Materials and Methods section. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra and HR-MS data for each new compound are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S27†).

PMC9228987,"The synthesis of the compound BIQO-19 is summarized in Scheme 1. First, 2-amino-5-bromo benzoic acid (1) and pyrimidin-2-ylmethanamine (2) were used as starting materials to prepare 6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (3). Step 1: A mixture of 1 (5 mmol, 10.75 g), 2 (7.5 mmol, 7.18 mg), triethoxymethane (7.5 mmol, 11.10 g), and I2 (0.05 mmol, 0.13 g) were suspended in ethanol (EtOH) (150 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred for 6 h until reaction completion was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the ethanol vaporized under reduced pressure. The mixture was further dissolved with 200 mL ethyl acetate and washed once with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium hydroxide solution was extracted with ethyl acetate three times, combined with ethyl acetate extract, and washed successively with 1 M NaOH and saturated salt water. The ethyl acetate extract was collected and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. Sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and the ethyl acetate extract was concentrated to obtain compound 3 (6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one). Step 2: Compound 3 (10 mmol, 3.17 g), compound 4 (pinacol ester, 15 mmol, 3.3 g) and PdCl2(dppf) (0.28 mmol, 0.21 g) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) was stirred under argon at 100 °C for 4 h until reaction completion, then confirmed by TLC analysis. 1,4-Dioxane was removed under reduced pressure and the mixture was diluted with water (100 mL), then the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was collected and washed with water (2 × 100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated to obtain a yellow solid (5). Step 3: Compound 5 (10 mmol, 330 mg) and compound 6 (ethyl bromopyruvate, 30 mmol, 540 mg) were added into the EtOH (60 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h and cooled to 25 °C. NaHCO3 (30 mmol, 2.52 g) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred again for 12 h at 80 °C until reaction completion. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25 °C and the EtOH was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting products were purified using silica gel chromatography.

PMC5799307,"Synthesis and characterization of MDTG A fourteen-carbon fatty-acid modified DTG prodrug (MDTG) was synthesized by esterification of the 7-hydroxyl group of DTG with myristic acid with a final yield of 82.8% (Fig. 1a). The chemical structure of MDTG was thoroughly characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, positive electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). 1H NMR spectral analysis demonstrated the loss of the phenol proton peak at 12.5 p.p.m. in the DTG spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This was accompanied by chemical shifts at 0.9 p.p.m. and 1.26 p.p.m. for MDTG, representing the 10 (CH3R) and 20 (RCH2R) protons of the aliphatic fatty-acid chain. Chemical shifts at 2.73 p.p.m. and 1.8  p.p.m. correspond to protons at the Cα and Cβ positions of the aliphatic ester (COOR) alkyl chain (Supplementary Fig. 1b). 13C NMR spectral analysis of MDTG shows all 34 carbon atoms present in the modified drug (Supplementary Fig. 1c). ESI-MS analysis shows the exact mass of MDTG to be 629.33 (100%), with daughter ion peaks at 630.33 (36.8%) and 631.33 (3.9%) (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Additionally, strong absorption bands at 2915 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of MDTG correspond to asymmetric and symmetric methyl C–H stretches of the myristoyl alkyl group. Absorption bands at 1795 cm−1 and 1750 cm−1 in the spectra of myristoyl chloride and MDTG correspond to carbonyl C=O stretching of the acyl chloride and ester functional groups, respectively (Fig. 1b). XRD confirmed the crystalline forms of both DTG and MDTG, displaying unique diffractin patterns indicating different atomic arrangements within the crystal lattice of each compound (Fig. 1c). Aqueous solubility and IC50 were compared for both DTG and MDTG. MDTG exhibited an 8.7-fold decrease in aqueous solubility compared to DTG, confirming the expected enhanced hydrophobicity from the fatty acid conjugate (Fig. 1d). Kinetics of MDTG cleavage were assessed in whole blood. After 60 min, 79.9% of MDTG was cleaved while 88.7% was hydrolyzed in blood diluted ten-fold. By comparison, 15.2% of MDTG was hydrolyzed in blood spiked with an esterase inhibitor and 21.9% was cleaved after acetonitrile (ACN) addition. This changed little over a 300 min observation period (Supplementary Fig. 2e). HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity determined that the IC50 of MDTG was not statistically different from DTG (62.5 nM and 56.7 nM, respectively; P = 0.8397) (Fig. 1e), confirming that antiretroviral activity of DTG was not altered following modification.Fig. 1 Synthesis and characterization of MDTG. a A fourteen-carbon fatty-acid modified DTG prodrug (MDTG) was synthesized creating hydrophobic crystals at a final drug yield of 82.8%. b Absorption bands at 2915 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 in the MDTG Fourier-transformation infrared spectrum (FTIR) illustrate the methyl C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the myristic acid alkyl group. Bands at 1795 cm−1 in the myristoyl chloride and 1750 cm−1 in the MDTG FTIR spectrum correspond to carbonyl C = O stretching of the myristic acid acyl halide that reacts as the ester is formed in MDTG. c X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for DTG and MDTG demonstrates the crystalline structures of both drugs. d Aqueous solubility of DTG and MDTG demonstrates the decreased solubility of MDTG. ****P < 0.0001 DTG vs. MDTG. e IC50 was determined in vitro in MDM by HIV-1 RT inhibition after DTG and MDTG treatment over a range of concentrations (0.01–1000 nM). Chemical modification of DTG did not affect antiretroviral drug activity (56.7 nM and 62.5 nM for DTG and MDTG, respectively; P = 0.8397). Results are shown as the mean ± SEM of three replicates.

PMC8274518,"The FTIR spectrum of compound 1 displayed characteristic absorption bands for γ-lactone (1753 cm−1) and unsaturation (1645 and 1454 cm−1). On the basis of 13C/DEPT and mass spectra, the molecular weight of compound 1 was determined to be 476, corresponding to the molecular formula C30H36O5 of a dimeric sesquiterpene derivative. The formula indicated the presence of 13 double-bond equivalents, 6 of which were adjusted in 2 tricyclic frameworks, 5 in vinylic linkages, and the remaining 2 in carbonyl functionalities. The HR-ES-MS spectrum of compound 1 displayed two major fragment ion peaks at m/z =245 [C15H17O3]+ and 231 [C15H19O2]+ arising because of fission of the C–O–C linkage between two different sesquiterpenic units (asymmetric dimer). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 displayed two one-proton broad signals at δ 6.10 and 5.56 ascribed correspondingly to H-13'a and H-13'b protons, respectively, of exocyclic vinylic linkage. In addition, a pair of singlets at δ 4.74 and 4.41, each integrating for two protons, were assigned to H-15a/H-15'a and H-15b/H-15'b protons, respectively, of the other two exocyclic vinylic linkages. The corresponding signals for vinylic carbons resonated at δ 149.4 (C-11′) and 120.0 (C-13′); 142.2 (C-4) and 106.4 (C-15); and 141.2 (C-4′) and 106.6 (C-15′) in the 13C NMR spectrum. The signals for two carbonyl carbons at δ 179.4 (C-12) and 170.6 (C-12′) supported the presence of two lactone units. A two-proton singlet at δ 5.35 was ascribed to H-9 and H-9′ vinylic protons. Two one-proton multiplets at δ 4.48 and 4.46 were assigned to oxygenated methine protons (H-6 and 6′). The corresponding signals for the carbons linking two sesquiterpenic residues resonated at δ 76.8 (C-6) and 77.8 (C-6′) in the 13CNMR spectrum. Two three-proton singlets at δ 0.85 (s, H3-14) and δ 0.82 (s, H3-14′), and a three-proton doublet at δ 1.32 (J = 9.0 Hz, H3-13) in 1H NMR spectra were attributed to methyl protons. Extensive examination of the 1D and 2D NMR spectra revealed the presence of 30 carbon resonances comprising 9 quaternary carbons, 9 methine carbons, 9 methylene, and 3 methyl carbons. The HMBC experiment showed a significant correlation between H-6 and C-6′; H3-13 and C-12; H-7 and C-12; and H-7′ and C-12′. The NMR data of compound 1 were compared to bialantolactone (Jiang et al. 2011). Therefore, compound 1 was found to be 6-(eudesma-4(15), 8, 11(13)-trien-12, 8-olide-6-oxy) eudesma-4(15), 8-dien-12, 8-olide, a new heteromeric sesquiterpene lactone dimer from I. racemosa and was designated as racemolactone I.

The resulting mixture was stirred until the evolution of gases ceased (about 3 h) and then allowed to stand overnight. The excessive thionyl chloride was then evaporated in a vacuum, and the solid residue was treated with hexane. Hexane was re-evaporated, and this process was repeated once more to remove trace amounts of SOCl2.

PMC7187479,"Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaATo provide the mechanistic insight into the cascade annulation, a typical reaction under condition A was then carried out but quenched at 0 °C before heating. Consequently, donor 5 and its dienol tautomer 5 a (1:9), as determined by 1H NMR of the crude mixture,15 was completely recovered, suggesting that deprotonation did occur but the Michael–Dieckmann sequence was not activated. Additionally, no 1,4‐conjugate addition intermediates had been identified for many other vinylogous donors that we used to generate adducts 15–17, 23–26, 32, and 34 (Table 2), wherein all reactions were conducted and completed at lower temperature (0–50 °C). Taken together, these results imply that Michael addition is very likely to be a rate‐limiting step in the above domino reactions; once it is initiated, the ensuing Dieckmann condensation might take place spontaneously. Structurally, though vinylogous donors potentially suffer self‐condensation through their cross‐conjugated dienolates after deprotonation,1c, 16 however, no self‐condensation products have been detected in all cases (35 examples) examined under reaction condition A, B, and C in Table 2. According to retrosynthetic analysis shown in pathway A (Scheme 1), fragments 1 and 2 are apparently two feasible chemical elements to implement the Michael‐type [4+2] anionic annulation which had been experimentally realized in many cases as shown in Table 2. Encouraged by these results, we decided to carry out the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX based on the original design (Scheme 4). Starting with bis‐benzyl protected tetralone 48, enone ester 50 was readily prepared in 57 % over 4 steps through a similar synthetic sequence for enone ester 5 as depicted in Scheme 2. Vinylogous donor 50 was then treated with aldehyde 2 under standard conditions to afford tricyclic aldehyde 53 in 53 % yield. Aldehyde 2 was readily prepared in 78 % yield through a Wittig reaction in the presence of ylide 51 and 2‐butynal, formed in situ by oxidation of 2‐butynol with MnO2. A series of cascade events, involving metal‐catalyzed cycloisomerization, proton demetallation, Friedel–Crafts acylation, and ring closure, was then successfully triggered between compound 53 and orcinol under catalysis with PtCl2 to give the corresponding intermediates 55 and 56 (1:1 as determined by 1H NMR), which contained requisite D, E, and F rings by putatively invoking the intermediacy of the metal‐benzopyrilium 54 species as an initiator.17 Without purification, the mixture was further deprotected through hydrogenolysis under catalysis with Pd/C to accomplish the desired target, in racemic form, in 65 % yield over 2 steps. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX, whose structure is further unambiguously confirmed by an X‐ray crystallographic analysis,18 are in good agreement with those reported for the naturally occurring product.11c, 11d, 19   Scheme 4 Application to the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX.",(±)‐ABX,N/A,"The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX","The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,31944523.0,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2020 Apr 16; 59(16):6540-6545,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,2020.0,CC BY,2021-01-06 08:08:04,no

PMC6268391,"Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless gum. The molecular formula of 1 was determined as C13H22O by the HRTOF-MS signal at m/z 194.1659 (calcd. 194.1671). The 1H-NMR of 1 showed two proton signals of oxygen bearing methine groups at δ 5.144 (1H, m) and 4.947 (1H, m), as well as the signals of one vinyl methyl at δ 1.490 (3H, s), one doublet methyl at 1.518 (3H, d, J = 4.8 Hz), and two quaternary methyls at 0.974 (6H, s). Its 13C-NMR and DEPT spectral data of 137.55 (s) and 124.58 (s) indicated the presence of olefinic group, which was supported by the IR spectral signal of 1,634 cm−1. The remaining 11 carbon signals were assigned by DEPT and HSQC as four methyls, four methylenes, two oxygen bearing methines, and one quaternary carbon. The 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 1 showed cross peaks between δ 2.26 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and δ 5.144 (H-3). The latter proton signal also showed COSY correlations with δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b). These spectral features indicated a structural fragment of a (Figure 2). Similarly, another fragment b (Figure 2) could be determined by analysis of the COSY correlations between δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b), 1.861 (H-8a), 1.675 (H-8b), 4.947 (H-9), and 1.518 (H3-10). The HMBC spectrum of 1 showed correlations from δ 2.260 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and 0.974 (H3-11 and 12) to δ 37.97 (C-1) and 137.55 (C-6), as well as from δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b) to δ 37.97 (C-1), 124.58 (C-5) and 137.55 (C-6) (Figure 3). On the other hand, the HMBC correlations between the two olefinic carbon signals and δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b), as well as δ 1.490 (H3-13) were observed. A further analysis of the ROESY correlation between H2-4 and H3-13 allowed the establishment of structural fragment c (Figure 2 and Figure 3). By combined analysis of the above evidences, 1 was indicated as a derivative of 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol [17,18,19]. The downfield shifts of 13C-NMR signals for C-3 and C-9 to δ 72.14 and 75.31 respectively, suggested an ether linkage between C-3 and C-9. There was no valuable information for stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 in the ROESY spectrum. The stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 were tentatively assigned to be R by comparison of the 13C-NMR data with those of the 3R or 9R-O-glycosylated 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol derivatives [20,21,22]. This was also supported by the presence of (3R,9R)-3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionyl 6-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (1a), which was supposed to be the precursor of 1 in fresh tea leaves [19]. On the basis of these evidences, 1 was identified as 3R,9R-oxido-5-megastigmene.","3R,9R-oxido-5-megastigmene",N/A,"The 1H-NMR of 1 showed two proton signals of oxygen bearing methine groups at δ 5.144 (1H, m) and 4.947 (1H, m), as well as the signals of one vinyl methyl at δ 1.490 (3H, s), one doublet methyl at 1.518 (3H, d, J = 4.8 Hz), and two quaternary methyls at 0.974 (6H, s)","Its 13C-NMR and DEPT spectral data of 137.55 (s) and 124.58 (s) indicated the presence of olefinic group, which was supported by the IR spectral signal of 1,634 cm−1.
