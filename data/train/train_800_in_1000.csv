PMC10102081,"The following procedure was adapted from Kouklovsky et al. (1990). A dry flask flushed with Ar was charged with (1S)-camphorquinone (5.83 g, 35.1 mmol, 1 eq) and dry THF (200 mL), then cooled to −78 °C. L-Selectride (1 M in THF, 42 mmol, 1.20 eq; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis MO, USA) was added over 1 h, and the mixture was stirred an additional 5 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 3 M HCl in methanol (16 mL) over 10 min at −78 °C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes). The fractions rich in the desired product were concentrated and subjected to flash column chromatography (20% EtOAc/Hexanes) to partially separate the isomers of hydroxycamphor. The resulting material was sublimed with a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus (55 °C, 0.1 Torr), yielding 397 mg (7%) of (1S)-exo-2, 92% isomerically pure (NMR).

PMC6255260,"3.5. Isolation of chysoeriol-7-O-rutinoside by preparative liquid chromatography Air dried plant material (500 g) was extracted with 1500 ml of methanol at 60 °C. Filtrated extract was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 200 ml of methanol-water (1:1, v/v). Chlorophyll was removed by extraction with chloroform. Purified extract was evaporated under reduced pressure until methanol is removed. The water layer was partitioned against ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was again partitioned against water. This water extract was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in methanol and applied on silica gel 60, 20 x 20 cm, 1.0 mm thin layer TLC plates as a 15 cm band. The plate was developed using 100:25:10:10:11 (v/v/v/v/v) ethyl acetate-dichloromethane-formic acid-acetic acid-water The chromatographic band (RF=0.13) expected to contain the compound was scraped off and extracted with methanol. To purify the compound, preparative liquid chromatography was done once more using ethyl acetate-methanol-formic acid-water (100:13.5:2.5:10, v/v/v/v) as mobile phase and the same stationary phase. Purified compound (RF=0.25) was again extracted with methanol, filtered through 0.45 µm filter, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol and checked for purity by HPLC-DAD-MS.

After stirring for 24 h at 20 °C, the mixture was poured into ice water; a precipitate was filtered off, washed with water, and dried on air to give 4-nitrobenzotriazole (25.5 g, 92.5%), which was used without further purification. Crude 4-nitrobenzotriazole (10 g, 47.8 mmol) was suspended in concentrated H2SO4 (120 mL), cooled to 0 °C, and then fuming HNO3 (20 mL, d 1.5 g/cm3) was added dropwise. A reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 20 °C and for 3 h at 120 °C. After cooling to 20 °C, it was poured into the crushed ice.

PMC9228987,"The synthesis of the compound BIQO-19 is summarized in Scheme 1. First, 2-amino-5-bromo benzoic acid (1) and pyrimidin-2-ylmethanamine (2) were used as starting materials to prepare 6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (3). Step 1: A mixture of 1 (5 mmol, 10.75 g), 2 (7.5 mmol, 7.18 mg), triethoxymethane (7.5 mmol, 11.10 g), and I2 (0.05 mmol, 0.13 g) were suspended in ethanol (EtOH) (150 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred for 6 h until reaction completion was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the ethanol vaporized under reduced pressure. The mixture was further dissolved with 200 mL ethyl acetate and washed once with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium hydroxide solution was extracted with ethyl acetate three times, combined with ethyl acetate extract, and washed successively with 1 M NaOH and saturated salt water. The ethyl acetate extract was collected and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. Sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and the ethyl acetate extract was concentrated to obtain compound 3 (6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one). Step 2: Compound 3 (10 mmol, 3.17 g), compound 4 (pinacol ester, 15 mmol, 3.3 g) and PdCl2(dppf) (0.28 mmol, 0.21 g) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) was stirred under argon at 100 °C for 4 h until reaction completion, then confirmed by TLC analysis. 1,4-Dioxane was removed under reduced pressure and the mixture was diluted with water (100 mL), then the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was collected and washed with water (2 × 100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated to obtain a yellow solid (5). Step 3: Compound 5 (10 mmol, 330 mg) and compound 6 (ethyl bromopyruvate, 30 mmol, 540 mg) were added into the EtOH (60 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h and cooled to 25 °C. NaHCO3 (30 mmol, 2.52 g) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred again for 12 h at 80 °C until reaction completion. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25 °C and the EtOH was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting products were purified using silica gel chromatography.

PMC4613290,"2. Results and Discussion Felixin F (1) was isolated as a white powder and the molecular formula for this compound was determined to be C26H40O5 (seven unsaturations) using high-resolution electron spray mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS) (C26H40O5 + Na, m/z 455.27662, calculated 455.27680). Comparison of the 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) data with the molecular formula indicated that there must be two exchangeable protons, which require the presence of two hydroxy groups. The 13C NMR and DEPT data showed that this compound has 26 carbons (Table 1), including five methyls, eight sp3 methylenes (including one oxymethylene), six sp3 methines (including one oxymethine), four sp3 quaternary carbons, and three carbonyls. Thus, from the above data, three degrees of unsaturation were accounted for and 1 was identified as a tetracyclic sesterterpenoid analogue. From the 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) of 1 (Table 1), it was possible to establish the separate system that maps out the proton sequences from H2-1/H2-2/H2-3, H-5/H2-6/H2-7, H-9/H2-11, and H-14/H2-15/H-16/H-17/H-18/H-25. These data, together with the key heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) correlations between protons and quaternary carbons (Table 1), such as H2-3, H3-19, H3-20/C-4; H-9, H2-11, H-14, H3-21/C-8; H-5, H-9, H2-22/C-10; H2-11, H3-23/C-12; H2-11, H-14, H2-15, H-18, H3-23/C-13; and H-17, H3-26/C-24, established the main carbon skeleton of 1 as a 24-homoscalarane analogue [14]. The oxymethylene unit at δC 62.7 was correlated to the methylene protons at δH 4.07 and 3.93 in the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum and these methylene signals were 2J-correlated with C-10 (δC 42.7) and 3J-correlated with C-1 (δC 33.9), C-5 (δC 56.8), and C-9 (δC 61.8), proving the attachment of a hydroxymethyl group at C-10 (Table 1).",Felixin F,N/A,"The oxymethylene unit at δC 62.7 was correlated to the methylene protons at δH 4.07 and 3.93 in the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum and these methylene signals were 2J-correlated with C-10 (δC 42.7) and 3J-correlated with C-1 (δC 33.9), C-5 (δC 56.8), and C-9 (δC 61.8), proving the attachment of a hydroxymethyl group at C-10 (Table 1)","The oxymethylene unit at δC 62.7 was correlated to the methylene protons at δH 4.07 and 3.93 in the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum and these methylene signals were 2J-correlated with C-10 (δC 42.7) and 3J-correlated with C-1 (δC 33.9), C-5 (δC 56.8), and C-9 (δC 61.8), proving the attachment of a hydroxymethyl group at C-10 (Table 1)",N/A,"4.07, 3.93",N/A,"62.7, 42.7, 33.9, 56.8, 61.8",26378524.0,Int J Mol Sci. 2015 Sep 11; 16(9):21950-21958,Int J Mol Sci,2015.0,CC BY,2021-01-05 04:33:12,no

Results and Discussion Compound 1 was obtained as yellow orange oil, and its molecular formula was established to be C16H20O4 on the basis of the positive HRESIMS spectrum (m/z 299.1263, [M + Na]+) (Figure S1-1), requiring seven degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited two singlet methyls (δH 1.17 and 1.43), one hydroxymethyl (δH 3.47, 3.55), five olefinic protons (δH 5.38, 5.54, 5.92, 6.34, and 7.31), and one oxygenated methine (δH 3.93) (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum exhibited 16 carbon resonance signals that were classified with the help of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum, into six olefinic carbons (δC 104.8, 126.2, 132.5, 133.4, 135. 4, and 162.6) for three double bonds, a ketone carbonyl (δC 200.2), two methyls (δC 13.4 and 19.5), two methylenes including one oxygenated (δC 35.1 and 66.9), three methines (δC 35.6, 42.5, and 67.3), and two nonprotonated sp3 carbons (δC 52.0 and 86.6) (Table 1). The remaining degrees of unsaturation revealed a tricyclic ring system in 1 since four of seven degrees of unsaturation were accounted by for one carbonyl and three double bonds. Comprehensive analyses of the one-dimensional (1D) (1H and 13C) and two-dimensional (2D) [HSQC, 1H-1H homonuclear chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (1H-1H COSY), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)] NMR spectra of 1 determined its structure to be related to the recently reported 12,13-dedihydroversiol [9]. The only difference was found by the presence of an additional hydroxy at C-14 (δC 66.9), as evidenced by the COSY cross-peaks of H2-2 (δH 1.33, 1.89)/H-3 (δH 2.68)/H-4 (δH 5.92)/H-3/H2-14 (δH 3.47, 3.55), in addition to the HMBC correlations from the oxygenated methylene H2-14 to C-2 (δC 35.1), C-3 (δC 35.6), and C-4 (δC 133.4) (Figure 2). An additional COSY correlation between H-12 (δH 5.38)/H-13 (δH 7.31), as well as the HMBC cross-peaks from H-13 to C-8 (δC 86.6) and C-11 (δC 200.2), and from H3-16 (δH 1.17) to C-8/C-9 (δC 52.0)/C-10 (δC 42.5)/C-11 discerned the presence of the α,β-unsaturated ketone unit residing at C-11, C-12 (δC 104.8), and C-13 (δC 162.6).",1,N/A,"The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited two singlet methyls (δH 1.17 and 1.43), one hydroxymethyl (δH 3.47, 3.55), five olefinic protons (δH 5.38, 5.54, 5.92, 6.34, and 7.31), and one oxygenated methine (δH 3.93)","The 13C NMR spectrum exhibited 16 carbon resonance signals that were classified with the help of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum, into six olefinic carbons (δC 104.8, 126.2, 132.5, 133.4, 135. 4, and 162.6) for three double bonds, a ketone carbonyl (δC 200.2), two methyls (δC 13.4 and 19.5), two methylenes including one oxygenated (δC 35.1 and 66.9), three methines (δC 35.6, 42.5, and 67.3), and two nonprotonated sp3 carbons (δC 52.0 and 86.6)",N/A,"1.17, 1.43, 3.47, 3.55, 5.38, 5.54, 5.92, 6.34, 7.31, 3.93",N/A,"104.8, 126.2, 132.5, 133.4, 135. 4, 162.6, 200.2, 13.4, 19.5, 35.1, 66.9, 35.6, 42.5, 67.3, 52.0, 86.6",31817515.0,Mar Drugs. 2019 Dec 5; 17(12):686,Mar Drugs,2019.0,CC BY,2021-01-06 05:39:26,no

PMC7374721,"In 1896, German scientist, E. Knoevenagel discovered that the condensation of aldehydes or ketones with compounds containing an active methylene group in the presence of bases, resulting in the formation of ethylene derivatives43, which is widely used in the organic synthesis and in the chemical˗pharmaceutical and perfume industries55,56. Generally, the Knoevenagel condensation were in moderate yields (30–95%)57,58. Here, we have found that Knoevenagel reaction of rhodanine with aldehydes (RA reaction) has very high efficiency (>98%) under mild conditions (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 13). The reaction of equimolar 1b and 3a in Fig. 4a was conducted in DMSO˗d6 at 70 °C using small amount of triethylamine (TEA) as the catalyst. As shown in 1H NMR spectra of reaction mixture (Fig. 4b), 1b and 3a were mixed together without obvious reaction before TEA added. After adding TEA and heating to 70 °C, the –CH2– protons signal of 1b (4.41 ppm) and the –CHO– proton signal of 3a (10.01 ppm) almost completely disappeared in only 0.5 h, accompanied by the appearance of new protons for the newly produced carbon–carbon double bond (7.82 ppm). The calculated conversion was above 99% (entry 1 in Table 2). In 13C NMR (Fig. 4c), the –CH2– carbon signal of 1b was completely shifted to 122.86 ppm from 36.47 ppm as well as the –CHO– carbon signal of 3a was also completely shifted to 133.46 ppm from 193.70 ppm, further confirming the successful formation of carbon–carbon double bond. The high-resolution mass spectrometry HR˗MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 14) also supported the exact product structure that main peak with mass value of 301.9916 corresponded to the sum of the mass of the coupling product (279.00) and the mass of Na+ (22.99). Then, 1b–1c reacted with 3b–3e to afford a series of condensation products (Entry 2–6 in Table 2, Supplementary Figs. 15–24, 29–33) with more than 98% conversions. These results reveal that the RA reaction not only has excellent orthogonality to functional groups, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkynyl, alkenyl, and nitro groups, but also has very high conversions. Moreover, the RA reaction could be further conducted in other common solvents such as MeCN, DMF with nearly quantitative conversions (entry 7–8 in Table 2, Supplementary Figs. 25–28). High efficiency, high orthogonality to various groups, high regioselectivity, easily obtained reactants, and mild condition make RA reaction a very useful tool in polymer chemistry.59,60. Additionally, as expected, the product of RA reaction can also be used as an initiator for ring-opening polymerization of thiiranes, resulting in cyclic polythioether with controlled molecular weight (Supplementary Figs. 34, 35).Fig. 4 Rhodanine–aldehyde (RA) Knoevenagel reaction. a RA reaction and chemicals b 1H NMR and c13C NMR results of RA reaction between 1b and 3a.

PMC6268391,"Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless gum. The molecular formula of 1 was determined as C13H22O by the HRTOF-MS signal at m/z 194.1659 (calcd. 194.1671). The 1H-NMR of 1 showed two proton signals of oxygen bearing methine groups at δ 5.144 (1H, m) and 4.947 (1H, m), as well as the signals of one vinyl methyl at δ 1.490 (3H, s), one doublet methyl at 1.518 (3H, d, J = 4.8 Hz), and two quaternary methyls at 0.974 (6H, s). Its 13C-NMR and DEPT spectral data of 137.55 (s) and 124.58 (s) indicated the presence of olefinic group, which was supported by the IR spectral signal of 1,634 cm−1. The remaining 11 carbon signals were assigned by DEPT and HSQC as four methyls, four methylenes, two oxygen bearing methines, and one quaternary carbon. The 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 1 showed cross peaks between δ 2.26 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and δ 5.144 (H-3). The latter proton signal also showed COSY correlations with δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b). These spectral features indicated a structural fragment of a (Figure 2). Similarly, another fragment b (Figure 2) could be determined by analysis of the COSY correlations between δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b), 1.861 (H-8a), 1.675 (H-8b), 4.947 (H-9), and 1.518 (H3-10). The HMBC spectrum of 1 showed correlations from δ 2.260 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and 0.974 (H3-11 and 12) to δ 37.97 (C-1) and 137.55 (C-6), as well as from δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b) to δ 37.97 (C-1), 124.58 (C-5) and 137.55 (C-6) (Figure 3). On the other hand, the HMBC correlations between the two olefinic carbon signals and δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b), as well as δ 1.490 (H3-13) were observed. A further analysis of the ROESY correlation between H2-4 and H3-13 allowed the establishment of structural fragment c (Figure 2 and Figure 3). By combined analysis of the above evidences, 1 was indicated as a derivative of 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol [17,18,19]. The downfield shifts of 13C-NMR signals for C-3 and C-9 to δ 72.14 and 75.31 respectively, suggested an ether linkage between C-3 and C-9. There was no valuable information for stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 in the ROESY spectrum. The stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 were tentatively assigned to be R by comparison of the 13C-NMR data with those of the 3R or 9R-O-glycosylated 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol derivatives [20,21,22]. This was also supported by the presence of (3R,9R)-3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionyl 6-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (1a), which was supposed to be the precursor of 1 in fresh tea leaves [19].

PMC8274518,"The FTIR spectrum of compound 1 displayed characteristic absorption bands for γ-lactone (1753 cm−1) and unsaturation (1645 and 1454 cm−1). On the basis of 13C/DEPT and mass spectra, the molecular weight of compound 1 was determined to be 476, corresponding to the molecular formula C30H36O5 of a dimeric sesquiterpene derivative. The formula indicated the presence of 13 double-bond equivalents, 6 of which were adjusted in 2 tricyclic frameworks, 5 in vinylic linkages, and the remaining 2 in carbonyl functionalities. The HR-ES-MS spectrum of compound 1 displayed two major fragment ion peaks at m/z =245 [C15H17O3]+ and 231 [C15H19O2]+ arising because of fission of the C–O–C linkage between two different sesquiterpenic units (asymmetric dimer). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 displayed two one-proton broad signals at δ 6.10 and 5.56 ascribed correspondingly to H-13'a and H-13'b protons, respectively, of exocyclic vinylic linkage. In addition, a pair of singlets at δ 4.74 and 4.41, each integrating for two protons, were assigned to H-15a/H-15'a and H-15b/H-15'b protons, respectively, of the other two exocyclic vinylic linkages. The corresponding signals for vinylic carbons resonated at δ 149.4 (C-11′) and 120.0 (C-13′); 142.2 (C-4) and 106.4 (C-15); and 141.2 (C-4′) and 106.6 (C-15′) in the 13C NMR spectrum. The signals for two carbonyl carbons at δ 179.4 (C-12) and 170.6 (C-12′) supported the presence of two lactone units. A two-proton singlet at δ 5.35 was ascribed to H-9 and H-9′ vinylic protons. Two one-proton multiplets at δ 4.48 and 4.46 were assigned to oxygenated methine protons (H-6 and 6′). The corresponding signals for the carbons linking two sesquiterpenic residues resonated at δ 76.8 (C-6) and 77.8 (C-6′) in the 13CNMR spectrum. Two three-proton singlets at δ 0.85 (s, H3-14) and δ 0.82 (s, H3-14′), and a three-proton doublet at δ 1.32 (J = 9.0 Hz, H3-13) in 1H NMR spectra were attributed to methyl protons. Extensive examination of the 1D and 2D NMR spectra revealed the presence of 30 carbon resonances comprising 9 quaternary carbons, 9 methine carbons, 9 methylene, and 3 methyl carbons. The HMBC experiment showed a significant correlation between H-6 and C-6′; H3-13 and C-12; H-7 and C-12; and H-7′ and C-12′. The NMR data of compound 1 were compared to bialantolactone (Jiang et al. 2011). Therefore, compound 1 was found to be 6-(eudesma-4(15), 8, 11(13)-trien-12, 8-olide-6-oxy) eudesma-4(15), 8-dien-12, 8-olide, a new heteromeric sesquiterpene lactone dimer from I. racemosa and was designated as racemolactone I.

PMC9822294,"TT-(HThio)3 was prepared by Stille coupling between TTBr3 and tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane. In a typical reaction, TTBr3 (0.400 g; 0.920 mmol), (tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (1.264 g, 2.769 mmol), LiCl (0.390 g, 9.20 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (0.065 g, 0.092 mmol) and dry toluene (10 mL) are transferred inside a 100 mL dry Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is de-aerated by means of three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. The system is heated under a static nitrogen atmosphere at 120 °C for 16 h. The reaction is then cooled to room temperature, filtered on Buchner and the solvent removed in vacuum. The crude reaction mixture is purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 with DCM/hexane as eluents (Rf = 0.72 in hexane/AcOEt = 8/2). The product is further purified by precipitation from DCM with MeOH to give TT-(HThio)3 as a white solid (0.390 g, 0.56 mmol, Yield: 61%).

Then 10.0 ml of water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was then partitioned between CH2Cl2 (50.0 ml) and 2 M aqueous sodium carbonate. The aqueous layer was extracted two more times with CH2Cl2 (30.0 ml), and the combined organic portions were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resulted residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum, 1/15) to obtain the title compound (0.84 g, 91.8%) as a yellow oil.

PMC6271822,"2. Results and Discussion The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed eight signals, three singlets between δ 3.94–4.03 indicative of three methoxyl groups; three aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.68 and 7.18 (two doublets with J = 9.0 Hz) and δ 6.90 (s) and one singlet at δ 12.52 assigned to one chelated OH group placed at C1. The 13C-NMR spectrum further reveals signals of three methoxyl carbons (δ 57.5–61.9), three methine carbons (δ 99.3, 108.9, 119.8), ten non hydrogenated carbons, including one carbonyl group at δ 181.3 characteristic for a monochelated carbonyl carbon [10], two which have no oxygen substituent (both at δ 109.8) and seven of which have an oxygen substituent (137.6–155.9). The unambiguous attribution was established by means of two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic techniques. The chemical assignments of methine carbons C2, C3, C4 and methoxyl carbons in the 13C-NMR were achieved by HETCOR experiment [1J(CH)]. The other chemical shifts were assigned by long-range [2J(CH), 3J(CH) and 4J(CH)] correlation observed in the HMBC spectrum (Table 1). Its molecular formula (C16H14O7) was determined based on a peak in the HRESIMS data at m/z 319.0817 [M+H]+ (Calculated for C16H15O7), suggesting 10 degrees of unsaturation. These data were sufficient to consider the possibility of a pentasubstituted xanthone structure with two hydroxyl groups at C1 and C6. Thus, the structure of 1 was fully elucidated, and it was named moutabeone.  molecules-19-08885-t001_Table 1Table 1 1H-NMR (300 MHz) and 13C-NMR (75 MHz) spectral data for compound 1 in CDCl3.",1,N/A,"The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed eight signals, three singlets between δ 3.94–4.03 indicative of three methoxyl groups; three aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.68 and 7.18 (two doublets with J = 9.0 Hz) and δ 6.90 (s) and one singlet at δ 12.52 assigned to one chelated OH group placed at C1","The 13C-NMR spectrum further reveals signals of three methoxyl carbons (δ 57.5–61.9), three methine carbons (δ 99.3, 108.9, 119.8), ten non hydrogenated carbons, including one carbonyl group at δ 181.3 characteristic for a monochelated carbonyl carbon [10], two which have no oxygen substituent (both at δ 109.8) and seven of which have an oxygen substituent (137.6–155.9)",N/A,"3.94–4.03, 6.68, 7.18 (two doublets with J = 9.0 Hz), 6.90 (s), 12.52",N/A,"57.5–61.9, 99.3, 108.9, 119.8, 181.3, 109.8, 137.6–155.9",24972272.0,Molecules. 2014 Jun 26; 19(7):8885-8889,Molecules,2014.0,CC BY,2021-01-05 22:02:24,no

In addition, its 1H NMR spectrum recorded a singlet signal at δ = 13.34 ppm for NH. Also, the structure was supported by mass spectra, which agree with the molecular formula (see Experimental part). The chemical composition of 4 was also confirmed via chemical transformation.

PMC9639016,"As observed with Ph4PnH2,16 no nucleophilic attack from the C5 position of the cyclopentadiene on the enone seemed to take place, presumably due to steric hindrance by the substituents in the flanking 1,4 positions. Purification of the crude reaction mixture via column chromatography on silica using 5:1 cyclohexane/toluene as the eluent mixture yielded two products. The first fraction was identified as 1,3,6-tri-p-toluylpentafulvene (p-Tol3Fv, 8b), obtained as a dark orange-red solid in 28% yield. The formation of a pentafulvene from the reaction of a CpH with an enone likely reflects a retro-Aldol cleavage after the initial Michael addition that competes with the cyclizing condensation to furnish the PnH2 (see Section 2.3).21 The second fraction contained the new 1,3,4,6-tetra-p-tolyl-1,2-dihydropentalene (p-Tol4PnH2, 8a) as a cherry-red solid in 36% yield. Like Ph4PnH2,16 the former was obtained exclusively as the 1,2-isomer, displaying a similar 1H NMR coupling pattern of the proton at C1 (4.56 ppm) and the two protons at C2 (4.10 and 3.42 ppm) with similar 13C NMR shifts of the C1 (42.3 ppm) and C2 (55.4 ppm; for details, see Figure S12). Although a heavier molecule, the air-stable 8a possessed a melting point of 84 °C lower than Ph4PnH2 (p-Tol4PnH2 96–97 °C; Ph4PnH2 180–181 °C), indicating a decreased lattice energy due to less favorable packing in the solid state. This trend was also confirmed by an observed increase in solubility of 8a relative to Ph4PnH2 and comparing the melting point of p-Tol4PnH2 with its corresponding fulvene 8b, which possesses a lower molecular weight but melts at 105 °C. Since Ph3Fv successfully underwent cyclization with acetophenone via [6 + 2] addition to give Ph4PnH2 in our previous work,16 we investigated the analogous reaction between 8b and para-methylacetophenone in MeOH/toluene to see if the isolated pentafulvene side product may be converted into a dihydropentalene separately. While p-Tol3Fv was nearly fully consumed after 44 h, p-Tol4PnH2 was only obtained in 5% yield. Since pentafulvene formation represented a competitive side reaction, we briefly investigated the possibility of increasing dihydropentalene selectivity. Using one equivalent of NaOtBu in dry THF to activate the cyclopentadiene and conducting the cyclizing double condensation with the enone at room temperature yielded 8a in 33% yield and 8b in 7%. This result shows that using a stoichiometric amount of a strong, ionic base at low temperatures may lower the amount of fulvene formation (4.7:1 DHP/Fv ratio versus 1.3:1 using excess pyrrolidine in refluxing MeOH/toluene) but may not completely suppress it. As the pyrrolidine route generally produced higher yields, we chose to apply this protocol for all other substrates discussed in the following, but note that pentafulvene selectivity may be decreased using alternative reaction conditions if desired (see Section S1).","1,3,4,6-tetra-p-tolyl-1,2-dihydropentalene",N/A,"Like Ph4PnH2,16 the former was obtained exclusively as the 1,2-isomer, displaying a similar 1H NMR coupling pattern of the proton at C1 (4.56 ppm) and the two protons at C2 (4.10 and 3.42 ppm) with similar 13C NMR shifts of the C1 (42.3 ppm) and C2 (55.4 ppm; for details, see Figure S12)","Like Ph4PnH2,16 the former was obtained exclusively as the 1,2-isomer, displaying a similar 1H NMR coupling pattern of the proton at C1 (4.56 ppm) and the two protons at C2 (4.10 and 3.42 ppm) with similar 13C NMR shifts of the C1 (42.3 ppm) and C2 (55.4 ppm; for details, see Figure S12)",N/A,"4.56, 4.10, 3.42",N/A,"42.3, 55.4",36196644.0,J Org Chem. 2022 Nov 4; 87(21):13790-13802,J Org Chem,2022.0,CC BY,2022-11-08 23:18:40,no

Protective Effect on Injured PC12 Cells PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with horse serum (10% v/v), fetal bovine serum (5%, v/v), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 µ/mL) (Thermo Technologies, New York, NY, USA) at 37 °C when humidified with CO2 (5%). When the cells achieved the density of 80%, the original medium was removed and cells were cultured with the serum-free medium for 14 h. Then the cells were suspended in 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and seeded into poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well culture plates at 7 × 103 cells/well, differentiated, and treated with 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF) for 48 h. Followed by these treatments, the differentiated PC12 cells were pretreated with various doses (60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 3.75 µg/mL) for 36 h. All measurements were performed after the cells were induced by CoCl2 (final concentration, 300 µM) for 12 h. The control-differentiated cells were not treated. CoCl2 was dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium. After MTT solution (20 µL, 5 mg/mL) was added to each well, the plate was incubated for a further 4 h at 37 °C. The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a BIORAD 550 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). The proliferation rates of damaged PC12 cells were calculated by the formula [OD490 (Sample)−OD490 (CoCl2)]/[OD490 (NGF) − OD490 (CoCl2)] × 100%.","M4 (4-((3,5,6-trimethylpyrazin-2-yl)methoxy)benzoic acid)",N/A,"1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 8.07 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Ar-H), 7.07 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Ar-H), 5.26 (s, 2H, -CH2), 2.63 (s, 3H, -CH3), 2.56 (s, 3H, -CH3), 2.56 (s, 3H, -CH3)","13C-NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 171.2, 162.9, 151.6, 150.0, 148.9, 145.1, 132.3, 122.4, 114.6, 69.9 (-CH2), 21.7 (-CH3), 21.4 (-CH3), 20.5 (-CH3)","500 MHz, CDCl3","8.07 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Ar-H), 7.07 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Ar-H), 5.26 (s, 2H, -CH2), 2.63 (s, 3H, -CH3), 2.56 (s, 3H, -CH3), 2.56 (s, 3H, -CH3)","150 MHz, CDCl3","171.2, 162.9, 151.6, 150.0, 148.9, 145.1, 132.3, 122.4, 114.6, 69.9, 21.7, 21.4, 20.5",29751639.0,Molecules. 2018 May 11; 23(5):1154,Molecules,2018.0,CC BY,2021-01-05 20:20:55,no

PMC8810545,"Compound 3 was isolated as a colorless gum. A molecular formula of C25H38O6 was deduced from HRESIMS data [m/z 457.2557 [M+H]+; calcd. 457.2560] and using NMR data, accounting for seven indices of hydrogen deficiency. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed 25 carbon resonances, which were identified by means of HSQC data as four methyl, nine methylenes, five methines, and seven quaternary carbons. The 13C NMR data showed signals for a di-substituted double bond (δC 151.5, 111.9), a trisubstituted double bond (δC 169.3, 116.5), and two carbonyl carbons (δC 173.1, 183.1). Three carbon signals at δC 71.1, 74.5, and 82.5 indicated the presence of oxygen-bearing sp3 carbons. According to the degree of unsaturation, the structure of 3 should be tricyclic due to the absence of any other sp or sp2 carbon signals. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 3 showed the presence of four methyl singlets at δH 0.84, 1.14, 1.15, and 2.08, as well as three vinyl protons at δH 5.79, 4.98, and 5.15. The NMR data of 3 (Table 1) suggested that its structure resembled that of lachnocalyxolide B, a sesterterpenoid previously isolated from Salvia lachnocalyx Hedge by Farimani and Mazarei (2014). Inspection of the NMR data revealed lack of the C-6 oxygenated methine group in compound 3, and rather the presence of an additional methylene group (δ H-6 1.28, 1.40; δ C-6 23.8). This suggested the replacement of the lactone moiety by a hydroxy acid in 3. The relative configuration of the decalin moiety was assigned to be 4R *, 5R *, 8R *, 9R *, 10S *, based on NOESY correlations between H-25, H-24, and H-22, as well as NOE between H-9 and H-5. To determine the relative configuration of centers C-14 and C-16, DP4+ NMR chemical shift probability calculation was implemented (Grimblat et al., 2015). Generated conformers for two stereoisomers, 14S, 16R and 14R, 16R, were subjected to geometrical optimization followed by NMR chemical shift calculation at CPCM/mPW1PW91/6-31+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis sets and level of theories. Calculation of DP4+ probability value indicated 14S, 16R (isomer 2) with probability of 100% to be the correct stereoisomer (Supplementary Figure S62). The results further supported by comparison of calculated total correlation coefficients for both isomers (0.99041 for isomer 1 and 0.99430 for isomer 2; Supplementary Figure S63). Additionally, calculation of ECD spectra for the aforementioned stereoisomers could further confirm both relative and absolute configuration of compound 3 (Figure 6).",lachnocalyxolide B,N/A,"The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 3 showed the presence of four methyl singlets at δH 0.84, 1.14, 1.15, and 2.08, as well as three vinyl protons at δH 5.79, 4.98, and 5.15","The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed 25 carbon resonances, which were identified by means of HSQC data as four methyl, nine methylenes, five methines, and seven quaternary carbons.

PMC10051936,"By using FT-IR, 1H and 13C-NMR techniques, a characterization of the prepared benzoxazine monomer was conducted before curing. The condensation of eugenol and melamine and formaldehyde was used to synthesize EM-Bzo (Figure 1a). In the FT-IR spectrum (Figure 1b), EM-Bzo exhibits a characteristic peak at 939 cmâˆ’1, denoting oxazine ring structure at 1246 and 1022 cmâˆ’1 due to the asymmetric and symmetric vibration of Câ€“Oâ€“C, respectively. A band can be seen at 1142 cmâˆ’1 for the Câ€“Nâ€“C stretching vibrations, as well as a peak at 1372 cmâˆ’1 caused by tetra-substituted benzene [24]. Furthermore, methoxy carbonyl bound to the benzene ring exhibited symmetric and asymmetric vibrations at 1021 and 1247 cmâˆ’1, respectively. Moreover, eugenolâ€™s alkyl chain, as well as the methylene group of its benzoxazine ring, gave bands between 2976 and 2828 cmâˆ’1, respectively [25]. In addition to 1H-NMR analysis, 13C-NMR analysis provided further structural insight into the synthesized EM-Bz monomer. EM-Bz is a benzoxazine-containing eugenol and melamine that can be viewed simultaneously due to its specific chemical structure. The spectra of benzoxazine synthesized in Figure 1c can be seen in this figure. As a result, benzoxazine monomers exhibit proton resonances with two singlets of equal intensity. This is because of the presence of â€“CH2 protons, located at 4.5 and 5.2 ppm with respect to Nâ€“Câ€“Ar and Nâ€“Câ€“O, respectively. The â€“OCH3 protons produce a singlet at 3.8 ppm. The peaks at 3.2, 5.9 and 5.0 ppm can be ascribed to protons of allyl group. Between 6.5 to 7.5 ppm the aromatic rings contribute protons. Moreover, the 13C-NMR spectrum shown in Figure 1d shows a characteristic carbon resonance striking the oxazine ring at 49 ppm and 79 ppm, respectively. Aromatic carbons are all found between 110 and 150 ppm, with the peak at 56 ppm associated with â€“OCH3 carbon, apart from 116, 142 and 40.4 ppm being attributed to the allyl carbon [26].",EM-Bzo,N/A,"This is because of the presence of â€“CH2 protons, located at 4.5 and 5.2 ppm with respect to Nâ€“Câ€“Ar and Nâ€“Câ€“O, respectively.

The sequence of this trisaccharide moiety was established as β-d-oleandropyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-cymaropyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-cymaropyranoside, based on the HMBC correlations from H-1′′′′ (δH 4.73) to C-4′′′ (δC 83.9), and from H-1′′′ (δH 4.60) to C-4′′ (δC 83.9).

The DEPT-135 (Supplementary Fig. 42) and 1H NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig. 40) of 7 indicated that it had nine methylene groups, one less than the number of methylene groups in GA-HLDOA. Meanwhile, a carbon with δC 145.04 appeared in the 13C NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 41), suggesting that a methylene group of GA-HLDOA was transformed to a ketone group. The HMBC (Supplementary Fig. 45) between the carbon (δC 145.04) and H-6 (2.50 m, 2.56 m, 2H) indicated that the C-7 was a ketone group.

This solution was then cooled to 0 °C and subsequently sparged with O2 for 10 min. The reaction was kept at 0 °C while ozone was then bubbled (2 L/min, 35% power). After stirring for 35 min, the reaction was deemed to be incomplete based on LCMS analysis and additional oxime (0.806 g, 4.50 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was added in a single portion to the reaction mixture. Ozone was bubbled through the reaction for another 60 min, at which point additional oxime (0.806 g, 4.50 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was added in a single portion to the reaction. The ozone power was increased to 40% and ozone addition was continued for another 80 min until the reaction was judged complete by TLC and HPLC analysis. The reaction mixture was then purged of ozone by bubbling with O2 for 10 min, followed argon gas for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen.

PMC3472718,"5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-tetrazole was synthesized from 4-chlorobenzonitrile by following a reported procedure [23]. 4-chlorobenzonitrile in turn was obtained from 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, following a reported procedure [24]. Nitrile (2.66 g, 20 mmol), sodium azide (1.43 g, 22 mmol) and zinc bromide (4.50 g, 20 mmol), were put in 60 mL of water. Five microliter of isopropanol was also added to stop the formation of clumps. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h and monitored by TLC; vigorous stirring is essential. After 24 h HCl (3 N, 30 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL) were added, and vigorous stirring was continued until no solid was present and the aqueous layer had a pH of 1. If necessary, additional ethyl acetate was added. The organic layer was isolated and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were evaporated, 250 mL of 0.25 N NaOH was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min, until the original precipitate was dissolved and a suspension of zinc hydroxide was formed. The suspension was filtered, and the solid washed with 50 mL of 1 N NaOH. To the filtrate was added 50 mL of 3 N HCl with vigorous stirring causing the tetrazole to precipitate. The tetrazole was filtered and washed with 100 mL of 3 N HCl and dried in a drying oven to furnish the tetrazole as a white powder.

PMC6832413,"3.2.4. Synthesis of Lansiumamide B (2) A flame-dried round bottle under argon atmosphere was charged with lansiumamide A (1) (1.03 g, 4.13 mmol) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 15 mL). The solution was cooled to −78 °C and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS, 5 mL, 1.0 M in THF, 5.0 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was warmed to 0 °C gradually, stirred for an additional 30 min and then cooled to −78 °C. Iodomethane (0.63 mL, 10 mmol) was added dropwise to the cold solution. The reaction mixture was then allowed to gradually warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. Aqueous saturated NH4Cl solution (5 mL) was added under vigorous stirring to quench the reaction. The volatiles (mainly THF) were removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic fractions were washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using eluents (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 10/1) to afford lansiumamide B (2) as yellowish oil, which would solidify after storage in the refrigerator (1.03 g, 95% yield). In order to obtain the analytical sample, recrystalization was carried out with diethyl ether and yellowish plates were secured. Mp = 73–74 °C.

PMC5799307,"Synthesis and characterization of MDTG A fourteen-carbon fatty-acid modified DTG prodrug (MDTG) was synthesized by esterification of the 7-hydroxyl group of DTG with myristic acid with a final yield of 82.8% (Fig. 1a). The chemical structure of MDTG was thoroughly characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, positive electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). 1H NMR spectral analysis demonstrated the loss of the phenol proton peak at 12.5 p.p.m. in the DTG spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This was accompanied by chemical shifts at 0.9 p.p.m. and 1.26 p.p.m. for MDTG, representing the 10 (CH3R) and 20 (RCH2R) protons of the aliphatic fatty-acid chain. Chemical shifts at 2.73 p.p.m. and 1.8  p.p.m. correspond to protons at the Cα and Cβ positions of the aliphatic ester (COOR) alkyl chain (Supplementary Fig. 1b). 13C NMR spectral analysis of MDTG shows all 34 carbon atoms present in the modified drug (Supplementary Fig. 1c). ESI-MS analysis shows the exact mass of MDTG to be 629.33 (100%), with daughter ion peaks at 630.33 (36.8%) and 631.33 (3.9%) (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Additionally, strong absorption bands at 2915 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of MDTG correspond to asymmetric and symmetric methyl C–H stretches of the myristoyl alkyl group. Absorption bands at 1795 cm−1 and 1750 cm−1 in the spectra of myristoyl chloride and MDTG correspond to carbonyl C=O stretching of the acyl chloride and ester functional groups, respectively (Fig. 1b). XRD confirmed the crystalline forms of both DTG and MDTG, displaying unique diffractin patterns indicating different atomic arrangements within the crystal lattice of each compound (Fig. 1c). Aqueous solubility and IC50 were compared for both DTG and MDTG. MDTG exhibited an 8.7-fold decrease in aqueous solubility compared to DTG, confirming the expected enhanced hydrophobicity from the fatty acid conjugate (Fig. 1d). Kinetics of MDTG cleavage were assessed in whole blood. After 60 min, 79.9% of MDTG was cleaved while 88.7% was hydrolyzed in blood diluted ten-fold. By comparison, 15.2% of MDTG was hydrolyzed in blood spiked with an esterase inhibitor and 21.9% was cleaved after acetonitrile (ACN) addition. This changed little over a 300 min observation period (Supplementary Fig. 2e). HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity determined that the IC50 of MDTG was not statistically different from DTG (62.5 nM and 56.7 nM, respectively; P = 0.8397) (Fig. 1e), confirming that antiretroviral activity of DTG was not altered following modification.Fig. 1 Synthesis and characterization of MDTG. a A fourteen-carbon fatty-acid modified DTG prodrug (MDTG) was synthesized creating hydrophobic crystals at a final drug yield of 82.8%. b Absorption bands at 2915 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 in the MDTG Fourier-transformation infrared spectrum (FTIR) illustrate the methyl C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the myristic acid alkyl group. Bands at 1795 cm−1 in the myristoyl chloride and 1750 cm−1 in the MDTG FTIR spectrum correspond to carbonyl C = O stretching of the myristic acid acyl halide that reacts as the ester is formed in MDTG. c X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for DTG and MDTG demonstrates the crystalline structures of both drugs. d Aqueous solubility of DTG and MDTG demonstrates the decreased solubility of MDTG. ****P < 0.0001 DTG vs. MDTG. e IC50 was determined in vitro in MDM by HIV-1 RT inhibition after DTG and MDTG treatment over a range of concentrations (0.01–1000 nM).

The mixture is de-aerated by means of three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. The system is heated under a static nitrogen atmosphere at 120 °C for 16 h. The reaction is then cooled to room temperature, filtered on Buchner and the solvent removed in vacuum. The crude reaction mixture is purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 with DCM/ACN as eluents (Rf = 0.53 in DCM/ACN = 8/2). The product is further purified by precipitation from DCM with hexane to give TT-HThio as a white solid (0.535 g, 1.47 mmol, Yield: 70%).

PMC7187479,"Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaATo provide the mechanistic insight into the cascade annulation, a typical reaction under condition A was then carried out but quenched at 0 °C before heating. Consequently, donor 5 and its dienol tautomer 5 a (1:9), as determined by 1H NMR of the crude mixture,15 was completely recovered, suggesting that deprotonation did occur but the Michael–Dieckmann sequence was not activated. Additionally, no 1,4‐conjugate addition intermediates had been identified for many other vinylogous donors that we used to generate adducts 15–17, 23–26, 32, and 34 (Table 2), wherein all reactions were conducted and completed at lower temperature (0–50 °C). Taken together, these results imply that Michael addition is very likely to be a rate‐limiting step in the above domino reactions; once it is initiated, the ensuing Dieckmann condensation might take place spontaneously. Structurally, though vinylogous donors potentially suffer self‐condensation through their cross‐conjugated dienolates after deprotonation,1c, 16 however, no self‐condensation products have been detected in all cases (35 examples) examined under reaction condition A, B, and C in Table 2. According to retrosynthetic analysis shown in pathway A (Scheme 1), fragments 1 and 2 are apparently two feasible chemical elements to implement the Michael‐type [4+2] anionic annulation which had been experimentally realized in many cases as shown in Table 2. Encouraged by these results, we decided to carry out the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX based on the original design (Scheme 4). Starting with bis‐benzyl protected tetralone 48, enone ester 50 was readily prepared in 57 % over 4 steps through a similar synthetic sequence for enone ester 5 as depicted in Scheme 2. Vinylogous donor 50 was then treated with aldehyde 2 under standard conditions to afford tricyclic aldehyde 53 in 53 % yield. Aldehyde 2 was readily prepared in 78 % yield through a Wittig reaction in the presence of ylide 51 and 2‐butynal, formed in situ by oxidation of 2‐butynol with MnO2. A series of cascade events, involving metal‐catalyzed cycloisomerization, proton demetallation, Friedel–Crafts acylation, and ring closure, was then successfully triggered between compound 53 and orcinol under catalysis with PtCl2 to give the corresponding intermediates 55 and 56 (1:1 as determined by 1H NMR), which contained requisite D, E, and F rings by putatively invoking the intermediacy of the metal‐benzopyrilium 54 species as an initiator.17 Without purification, the mixture was further deprotected through hydrogenolysis under catalysis with Pd/C to accomplish the desired target, in racemic form, in 65 % yield over 2 steps. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX, whose structure is further unambiguously confirmed by an X‐ray crystallographic analysis,18 are in good agreement with those reported for the naturally occurring product.11c, 11d, 19   Scheme 4 Application to the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX.",(±)‐ABX,N/A,"The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX","The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,31944523.0,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2020 Apr 16; 59(16):6540-6545,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,2020.0,CC BY,2021-01-06 08:08:04,no

Derivatization of monosaccharides was realized according to Pierre et al. [31,32], dissolving the lyophilizate in pyridine and Sylon (BSTFA/TMCS; 99%/1%). The mix was incubated at room temperature 2 h and under Argon to form trimethylsilyl-O-glycosides which were solubilized in dichloromethane after evaporation of reagent. The samples were injected on an Agilent 6890 Series GC System coupled to an Agilent 5973 Network, equipped with an OPTIMA-1MS column (Macherey-Nagel; 30 m, 0.32 mm, 0.25 Âµm) from Machereyâ€“Nagel with a helium flow rate of 2.3 mL/min. The first time, temperature was at 100 Â°C for 3 min. In a second step an increment of 8 Â°C/min up to 200 Â°C for 1 min was applied before a final increment of 5 Â°C/min up to 250 Â°C. Electronic Impact (EI, 70 eV) ionization method was performed with the trap temperature set at 150 Â°C and the target ion was fixed at 40â€“800 m/z. The relative molar proportions were calculated using area normalization method.

Conclusions In this study, we successfully synthesized two conjugated microporous polymers, Py-BSU CMP and TBN-BSU CMP, using Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling of BSU-Br2 with Py-T and TBN-T, respectively. We characterized the chemical structures, physical properties, porosity, and morphology of these CMPs using various analytical techniques, including FTIR, solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and TEM. Both Py-BSU CMP and TBN-BSU CMP showed excellent thermal stability with Td10 up to 383 °C and char yield up to 48 wt% at 800 °C as measured by TGA. We also investigated the electrochemical performance of these CMPs and found that TBN-BSU CMP exhibited better performance due to its more extended π-conjugated system, higher specific surface area (391 m2 g−1), and total pore volume (0.30 cm3 g−1). Under the three-electrode measurement system, TBN-BSU CMP showed significantly better electrochemical performance with a capacitance of 70 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 compared to Py-BSU CMP. TBN-BSU CMP also demonstrated excellent stability with less capacitance decay (99.9%) in long-life-cycle energy storage devices. Finally, we believe that these BSU-linked CMPs, Py-BSU and TBN-BSU CMPs, hold great potential for other applications such as H2 production and gas conversion. Overall, our findings suggest that these CMPs could be attractive candidates for various energy storage and conversion applications.

PMC8162098,"The amphiphilic long-tail pH probe CS-1 was designed to allow the mapping of pH levels in different organelles in cancer cells. Its synthesis is summarized in Scheme 1. Briefly, CS-1 was synthesized in six successive steps. First, compound 2 was obtained from A in two steps in good yield. Separately, 8-bromonaphthalic anhydride was reacted with ethylene diamine to give compound 3.40 Compound 3 was subject to N-alkylation with tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide intermediate 4. Reaction of 4 with 2 yielded compound 5. Finally, the tert-butyl group present in 5 was deprotected by treatment with TFA giving the desired long-tail amphiphilic pH probe, CS-1. Two reference compounds, R1 and R2, were prepared so as to explore the role of the amino centres labelled as N (a′/b′) in controlling the putative pH-dependent fluorescence response. The synthesis of compounds 1–7, CS-1, R1, and R2 is described in the Materials and Methods section. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra and HR-MS data for each new compound are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S27†). We chose naphthalimide as the core fluorophore in the present study because it is relatively photostable and rather chemically inert.15,35,41",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,34094247.0,Chem Sci.; 11(36):9875-9883,Chem Sci,N/A,CC BY,2021-06-05 23:18:33,no

This was the first time colchicine was extracted from Gloriosa seeds using Super Critical Fluid Extractor (SCFE) (Figure 1). The extractor was loaded with 3 Kg of Gloriosa seeds powder containing 0.70% colchicine content for every batch. Liquid CO2 with 3% water was used as the co-solvent in the extraction medium, at varying pressure, i.e., 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 bar, at a temperature of 60 °C, which was kept constant for two hours. The study showed that the extraction at a pressure of 400 bar gave an optimum yield of 93.6% (w/w), on the basis of the colchicine content, i.e., 27% colchicine content (w/w) (Table 1).  3.2.

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C. The ethyl bromoacetate (0.43 g, 2.6 mmol) was added to the resulting mixture and continuously stirred at room temperature for 20 h. After completion of the reaction (TLC), the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (15 mL). The resulting precipitates were filtered off, dried, and then extracted with chloroform.

PMC7001828,"Phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) (0.171mol) was slowly added to dry dimethyl formamide at 273 K, and then 3,4-di­hydro­naphthalen-1(2H)-one (0.174 mol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 353 K for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into aqueous sodium acetate (3 mol l−1) and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporating the ethyl acetate gave an oil, which on cooling solidified to yield 1-chloro-3,4-di­hydro­naphthalene-2-carbaldehyde. The title compound was prepared by refluxing 1-chloro-3,4-di­hydro­naphthalene-2-carbaldehyde (0.01 mol) with benzohydrazide (0.01 mol) in ethanol (5 ml) and few drops of acetic acid for 8 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, excess ethanol was removed under vacuum and the residue was quenched with ice. The precipitate was filtered, dried and crystallized from ethanol. The completion of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction study were grown from an N,N-di­methyl­formamide solution by slow evaporation.

PMC10187637,"A reaction mixture of dec-9-en-2-one oxime (10, 0.72 g, 4.64 mmol, 1.0 eq.), potassium hydroxide (1.30 g, 46.4 mmol, 5.0 eq.), water (62.7 mg, 62.3 μL, 3.48 mmol, 0.75 eq.) and DMSO (8.9 mL) was heated at 90–100°C (using previously degassed DMSO on molecular sieves (3.5 Å) could increase the yield). Over a period of 2 h, a solution of 1,2-dichloroethane (1.38 g, 1.10 mL, 13.9 mmol, 3.5 eq.) in DMSO (1 mL) was added dropwise. After 1 h of 1,2-dichloroethane addition a secondary amount of potassium hydroxide (5.0 eq.) was added. After an overall reaction time of 4 h at 90–100°C the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and subsequently ice water (20 mL) was added. The mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 20 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4. After the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel [PE:dichloromethane (60:40) + 1% trimethylamine (v/v)] to obtain 3-(hex-5-en-1-yl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole (11a, 228 mg, 1.40 mmol, 30%) as yellowish oil.

Stirring was continued overnight at 50 °C. TLC monitoring showed completion of the reaction mixture after 16 h. Methanol was removed in vacuo, and the resulting oily residue was transferred into a separating funnel with ethyl acetate (100 mL). After washing with brine (3 × 30 mL) and drying over Na2SO4, ethyl acetate was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (86 g, 0–4% acetone in petroleum ether) to afford methyl ricinoleate 13 as a colorless oil (16.59 g, 75%) along with a small amount (4%) of a slightly less polar by-product 14. It eluted after a minor amount of a less polar mixture of methyl oleate and methyl linoleate, Rf ca. 0.75 (petroleum ether/acetone 80:20), which was the result of the esterification of the ~15% oleic + linoleic acids, which were contained in technical ricinoleic acid.

It showed IR absorptions for hydroxyl (3291 cm−1), methyl (2942 cm−1), double bond (1639 cm−1), and etherlinkage (1230 and 1021cm−1) (Figure S9). The 1H-NMR spectra (Table 1) of 1 showed the presence of a monosubstituted benzene moiety [δH 7.85 (2H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2,6), 7.45 (2H, t, J = 7.5 Hz, H-3,5), and 7.52 (1H, m, H-4)] and a p-substituted benzene moiety [δH 7.07 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-2′,6′) and 6.67 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-3′,5′)] [16].

PMC4738244,"Myxotritone C (4) was obtained as yellow needle, [α]D22 = +403.3 (c = 0.15, MeOH). Its molecular formula was assigned as C11H12O5 (6 degrees of unsaturation) by TOF-ESI-MS spectral data, which showed a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 225.0760 [M + H]+, 247.0573 [M + Na]+ (Fig. S24). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4 suggested the presence of similar subunit found in 1 except for 9-methyl signal (δC 17.9/δH 2.18) replaced by a methylol signal (δC 59.9/δH 4.29). This hypothesis was further confirmed by HMBC correlations (Fig. S23) (Fig. 4). The HMBC correlations from 9-CH2OH to C-3, C-4 and C-4a confirmed that the additional methylol group was connected with C-3. Similarly, the relative and absolute configurations of 4 were also deduced as 7S and 8S.  From the structural features of compounds 1–4, all these four compounds might come from same Non-Reduced Polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) origins. The putative biosynthetic pathway was suggested in the Fig. 6.  To study the potential effects of these metabolites, allelopathic potential of these compounds was tested with the root elongation of A. thaliana as model. The root growth of A. thaliana was inhibited after treatment with the compounds in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 7). The inhibition of compounds 1–4 at different concentrations was shown in Fig. 7. Compound 4 were found to retard the Arabidopsis seeds root significantly, with the inhibition rate of 75.9% at 8 μg/mL, whereas compounds 1 and 2 showed moderate inhibition activities. The results implied that this fungus might contribute to the defense of its host lichen.

PMC9077875,"For the disubstituted isoxazoles 2a, 3a, and 4a, the hydrogen atom attached to the isoxazole nucleus (H3 for 2a and 3a, H5 for 4a – Fig. 2) have notable differences in the chemical shifts of 1H NMR spectrum. The H3 atom in 3a (8.59 ppm) is more shielded than the H5 atom in 4a (8.89 ppm) by a difference of approximately 0.30 ppm, whereas H5 (4a) is more shielded than the H3 atom in 2a (9.12 ppm) by about 0.23 ppm (Fig. 2). With regard to 13C NMR spectra of disubstituted isoxazoles, the major differences between the chemical shifts of the 4,5 (2a and 3a) and the 3,4 (4a)-disubstituted regioisomers are related to the carbon atoms C3 in 2a and 3a, and C5 in 4a (Fig. 2). This is because the C5 atom signal (compound 4a) is approximately 10 ppm more deshielded than the corresponding atom (C3) in 2a and 3a (Fig. 2). For the 4,5-disubstituted regioisomers 2a and 3a, the signal of the ketone carbonyl attached at the 4-position of the isoxazole ring shows considerable differences in the chemical shifts of the 13C NMR spectrum, because the ketone carbonyl signal in 2a is more shielded than the ketone carbonyl in 3a by about 8.3 ppm (Fig. 2). Unambiguously, 3,5-disubstituted 4-formyl isoxazole 5a could be identified by the characteristic chemical shifts of aldehyde hydrogen and carbon of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 2).

The mixture was heated to reflux and stirred at reflux for 10 h. After the reaction was completed (detected by TLC), the reaction was quenched with water. The solution was worked up by the addition of 1 N NaOH (4 mL) and then extracted with EtOAc (20 mL × 3). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and condensed by rotary evaporation to yield a yellow oil.
