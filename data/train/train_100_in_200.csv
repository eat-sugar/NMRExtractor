PMC6255260,"3.5. Isolation of chysoeriol-7-O-rutinoside by preparative liquid chromatography Air dried plant material (500 g) was extracted with 1500 ml of methanol at 60 °C. Filtrated extract was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 200 ml of methanol-water (1:1, v/v). Chlorophyll was removed by extraction with chloroform. Purified extract was evaporated under reduced pressure until methanol is removed. The water layer was partitioned against ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was again partitioned against water. This water extract was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in methanol and applied on silica gel 60, 20 x 20 cm, 1.0 mm thin layer TLC plates as a 15 cm band. The plate was developed using 100:25:10:10:11 (v/v/v/v/v) ethyl acetate-dichloromethane-formic acid-acetic acid-water The chromatographic band (RF=0.13) expected to contain the compound was scraped off and extracted with methanol. To purify the compound, preparative liquid chromatography was done once more using ethyl acetate-methanol-formic acid-water (100:13.5:2.5:10, v/v/v/v) as mobile phase and the same stationary phase. Purified compound (RF=0.25) was again extracted with methanol, filtered through 0.45 µm filter, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol and checked for purity by HPLC-DAD-MS.

PMC7187479,"Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaATo provide the mechanistic insight into the cascade annulation, a typical reaction under condition A was then carried out but quenched at 0 °C before heating. Consequently, donor 5 and its dienol tautomer 5 a (1:9), as determined by 1H NMR of the crude mixture,15 was completely recovered, suggesting that deprotonation did occur but the Michael–Dieckmann sequence was not activated. Additionally, no 1,4‐conjugate addition intermediates had been identified for many other vinylogous donors that we used to generate adducts 15–17, 23–26, 32, and 34 (Table 2), wherein all reactions were conducted and completed at lower temperature (0–50 °C). Taken together, these results imply that Michael addition is very likely to be a rate‐limiting step in the above domino reactions; once it is initiated, the ensuing Dieckmann condensation might take place spontaneously. Structurally, though vinylogous donors potentially suffer self‐condensation through their cross‐conjugated dienolates after deprotonation,1c, 16 however, no self‐condensation products have been detected in all cases (35 examples) examined under reaction condition A, B, and C in Table 2. According to retrosynthetic analysis shown in pathway A (Scheme 1), fragments 1 and 2 are apparently two feasible chemical elements to implement the Michael‐type [4+2] anionic annulation which had been experimentally realized in many cases as shown in Table 2. Encouraged by these results, we decided to carry out the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX based on the original design (Scheme 4). Starting with bis‐benzyl protected tetralone 48, enone ester 50 was readily prepared in 57 % over 4 steps through a similar synthetic sequence for enone ester 5 as depicted in Scheme 2. Vinylogous donor 50 was then treated with aldehyde 2 under standard conditions to afford tricyclic aldehyde 53 in 53 % yield. Aldehyde 2 was readily prepared in 78 % yield through a Wittig reaction in the presence of ylide 51 and 2‐butynal, formed in situ by oxidation of 2‐butynol with MnO2. A series of cascade events, involving metal‐catalyzed cycloisomerization, proton demetallation, Friedel–Crafts acylation, and ring closure, was then successfully triggered between compound 53 and orcinol under catalysis with PtCl2 to give the corresponding intermediates 55 and 56 (1:1 as determined by 1H NMR), which contained requisite D, E, and F rings by putatively invoking the intermediacy of the metal‐benzopyrilium 54 species as an initiator.17 Without purification, the mixture was further deprotected through hydrogenolysis under catalysis with Pd/C to accomplish the desired target, in racemic form, in 65 % yield over 2 steps. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX, whose structure is further unambiguously confirmed by an X‐ray crystallographic analysis,18 are in good agreement with those reported for the naturally occurring product.11c, 11d, 19   Scheme 4 Application to the total synthesis of (±)‐ABX.",(±)‐ABX,N/A,"The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX","The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data obtained for the synthetic (±)‐ABX",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,31944523.0,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2020 Apr 16; 59(16):6540-6545,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,2020.0,CC BY,2021-01-06 08:08:04,no

PMC6268391,"Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless gum. The molecular formula of 1 was determined as C13H22O by the HRTOF-MS signal at m/z 194.1659 (calcd. 194.1671). The 1H-NMR of 1 showed two proton signals of oxygen bearing methine groups at δ 5.144 (1H, m) and 4.947 (1H, m), as well as the signals of one vinyl methyl at δ 1.490 (3H, s), one doublet methyl at 1.518 (3H, d, J = 4.8 Hz), and two quaternary methyls at 0.974 (6H, s). Its 13C-NMR and DEPT spectral data of 137.55 (s) and 124.58 (s) indicated the presence of olefinic group, which was supported by the IR spectral signal of 1,634 cm−1. The remaining 11 carbon signals were assigned by DEPT and HSQC as four methyls, four methylenes, two oxygen bearing methines, and one quaternary carbon. The 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 1 showed cross peaks between δ 2.26 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and δ 5.144 (H-3). The latter proton signal also showed COSY correlations with δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b). These spectral features indicated a structural fragment of a (Figure 2). Similarly, another fragment b (Figure 2) could be determined by analysis of the COSY correlations between δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b), 1.861 (H-8a), 1.675 (H-8b), 4.947 (H-9), and 1.518 (H3-10). The HMBC spectrum of 1 showed correlations from δ 2.260 (H-2a), 1.675 (H-2b) and 0.974 (H3-11 and 12) to δ 37.97 (C-1) and 137.55 (C-6), as well as from δ 2.337 (H-7a), 2.182 (H-7b) to δ 37.97 (C-1), 124.58 (C-5) and 137.55 (C-6) (Figure 3). On the other hand, the HMBC correlations between the two olefinic carbon signals and δ 2.727 (H-4a) and 2.337 (H-4b), as well as δ 1.490 (H3-13) were observed. A further analysis of the ROESY correlation between H2-4 and H3-13 allowed the establishment of structural fragment c (Figure 2 and Figure 3). By combined analysis of the above evidences, 1 was indicated as a derivative of 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol [17,18,19]. The downfield shifts of 13C-NMR signals for C-3 and C-9 to δ 72.14 and 75.31 respectively, suggested an ether linkage between C-3 and C-9. There was no valuable information for stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 in the ROESY spectrum. The stereochemistry of C-3 and C-9 were tentatively assigned to be R by comparison of the 13C-NMR data with those of the 3R or 9R-O-glycosylated 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol derivatives [20,21,22]. This was also supported by the presence of (3R,9R)-3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionyl 6-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (1a), which was supposed to be the precursor of 1 in fresh tea leaves [19].

PMC9228987,"The synthesis of the compound BIQO-19 is summarized in Scheme 1. First, 2-amino-5-bromo benzoic acid (1) and pyrimidin-2-ylmethanamine (2) were used as starting materials to prepare 6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (3). Step 1: A mixture of 1 (5 mmol, 10.75 g), 2 (7.5 mmol, 7.18 mg), triethoxymethane (7.5 mmol, 11.10 g), and I2 (0.05 mmol, 0.13 g) were suspended in ethanol (EtOH) (150 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred for 6 h until reaction completion was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the ethanol vaporized under reduced pressure. The mixture was further dissolved with 200 mL ethyl acetate and washed once with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium hydroxide solution was extracted with ethyl acetate three times, combined with ethyl acetate extract, and washed successively with 1 M NaOH and saturated salt water. The ethyl acetate extract was collected and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. Sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and the ethyl acetate extract was concentrated to obtain compound 3 (6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one). Step 2: Compound 3 (10 mmol, 3.17 g), compound 4 (pinacol ester, 15 mmol, 3.3 g) and PdCl2(dppf) (0.28 mmol, 0.21 g) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) was stirred under argon at 100 °C for 4 h until reaction completion, then confirmed by TLC analysis. 1,4-Dioxane was removed under reduced pressure and the mixture was diluted with water (100 mL), then the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was collected and washed with water (2 × 100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated to obtain a yellow solid (5). Step 3: Compound 5 (10 mmol, 330 mg) and compound 6 (ethyl bromopyruvate, 30 mmol, 540 mg) were added into the EtOH (60 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h and cooled to 25 °C. NaHCO3 (30 mmol, 2.52 g) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred again for 12 h at 80 °C until reaction completion. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25 °C and the EtOH was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting products were purified using silica gel chromatography. Compound 3, 6-bromo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one, was obtained as a white solid, yield 73.4%, ESI-MS: m/z 339.1, 341.1 [M + Na]+.
